                    "transcript": "The data engineer is one of the highest paying data roles with relatively low\ncompetition and a great future. But what does the data engineer\nactually do? The simple answer is that they designed,\nbuild and maintain the infrastructure for collecting,\nstoring and analyzing data, ensuring it's accessible,\nreliable and optimized for performance. But this is a very broad explanation. So let's get into the details of what\nindeed engineer would do day to day, the responsibilities you may have,\nthe exact skills you need, how much data engineers make and finally, I'll compare\nthe data engineer to other data roles, because that is going to give you\na complete understanding of this role. When you understand how a data engineer\ninteracts with other data roles in a team. Let's get started. The engineer might start today\nby monitoring and checking the health and operating of different data\npipelines and databases, because it's going to be up to them\nto ensure that things run smoothly. The data fuels other business functions,\nsuch as the work of a data analyst or a data scientist. So it's important that everything works. Next, they may optimize the performance\nof the databases and data processing tasks because dealing with large data\nsets take a lot of time and power. So we want to make things efficient. Now, when it comes to more specific tasks, the engineer is responsible for developing\nand maintaining ETL processes. ETL stands for Extract Transform Load,\nand it's basically about getting the right data from various sources\ninto the right places where we need it. For example, our own database. Next, a data engineer might do some data\ncleansing because through all of this we need to make sure that the data we have is of high quality\nand that it doesn't contain any problems. Of course, you also want the data in the right format\nduring the day or during the week. A data engineer will also collaborate\nmultiple times with other team members and stakeholders like data scientists,\nanalysts and other clients. For example, it can be requesting access\nto the right data or just making sure\nwe're meeting all the expectations. Of course,\na data engineer will do more things. They may create documentation, security\nmeasures and explore ways to upgrade the existing systems for increased\nefficiency and better capabilities. But these are some of the core\nresponsibilities of a data engineer. Today, let's talk about the salary\nyou can expect as a data engineer, and then we'll talk\nmore about the in-depth skills and compared the data engineer\nto the other data roles in the US. When you start off as a data engineer,\nyou're going to make roughly 100,000. It's going to depend a lot on your state,\nthe company and so on. But we can see that\naccording to Glassdoor, the range is about 83 to 130000. For a data engineer. For a senior data engineer,\nthe average salary is around 136,000 per year, of course, with a large range,\ndepending on different factors. And for you lead engineer, we're looking\nat around an average of 153,000 per year. Even if you're not located in the US,\nI think it should still give you a general understanding of the salary level\nand the data engineer. It paid it very well. Now let's quickly cover the skills\nto become a data engineer. This is according to indeed\npopular employment websites. First we have the coding skills. He did engineer will have solid programing skills with Python\nbeing really important for data engineers. They can also use a variety\nof other programing languages depending on the situation\nto accomplish tasks. So you do need to have strong programing\nfundamentals. Next, you'll want to be familiar with\ndatabase systems and database management. To do this, you will need to know sequel,\nwhich is a key skill, knowledge of diverse database solutions\nand an understanding of data. Warehousing is also essential. Now to work with big data. As a data engineer, you will need\nto understand the relevant tools. For example, Apache Spark Cloud is also\nvery important in today's landscape as a data engineer, where Microsoft Azure,\na US and Google Cloud platform and so on are really important skills\nand these are the most popular as well. Now I do want to emphasize\nthat you don't need to learn them all, but rather look at what companies\nyou want to work at and what they use. If you don't know this,\nthat's completely fine. And I think that's normal. US and Microsoft,\nthese are some of the most popular. It is also necessary to have a strong\nunderstanding of data analysis in itself. But in general, landing a data engineering role is not going to be the easiest thing because your work is really critical\nand can cause a lot of damage. It's done incorrectly. So you could run the data\npipeline or whatever, and therefore you often need\nsome data experience before you become a data engineer. I could mention a lot of more things, but I feel like there's no need\nin repeating myself. The data engineer is going to do\na lot of different things. I could talk for days,\nbut these are really the key skills. It's still unclear. Here is a job\nlisting from a major tech company where you can see\nwhat they actually desire yourself. Now we're going to compare it\nto some other data roles. And when comparing the data engineer\nto other data roles, it is clear that your focus more\non the architecture itself of the data and you're kind of building the foundation\nfor the data in the company. This data may then be used by other team\nmembers for analysis, for machine learning or whatever. You're not really going to work in the spotlight,\nbut your work is really important. Now, the data engineer is\njust one of many amazing data rules. And to learn more about other data\nrules as well, check out this video next. And have an amazing week, guys."

                    "transcript": "Hey there, guys, Paul here from theengineeringmindset.com. In this video, we are going to be looking at how electricity works. Now, this is pretty essential knowledge for any engineering, so we'll\nrun through the basic parts of what you need to know. So let's start at the very basics and for that, we need to\ntake a look at the atom. Everything, including\nyou, is made from atoms. All the materials we\nuse are made from atoms. The materials are just different because the construction of their atoms are slightly different. The atoms are made from three particles, two of which are found inside the nucleus and the third particle sits outside this. At the center of the\natom, we have the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, we have the neutrons, which have no charge, and\nwe also have the protons, which are positively charged. The neutrons and the\nprotons are much heavier than the electrons so these\nwill stay within the nucleus. Surround the nucleus are different\nlayers of orbital shells. These are like flight\npaths for the electrons. The electrons flow\nalong these flight paths much like a satellite orbits our plant, except that the electrons travel at almost the speed of light. The electrons are negatively charged and they are attracted\nto the positive charge of the protons. The electrons orbit around the nucleus in these orbital shells\nand there are a set numbers of how many electrons can\nbe in any one orbital shell. The number of protons, neutrons,\nand electrons an atom has tells us which material it is. Atoms hold on to their\nelectrons very tightly, but some materials will\nhold on to them more tightly than others. The outer-most shell is\nknown as the valence shell, and in this shell, some materials have\nloosely bound electrons which can flow to other atoms. Atoms which can pass electrons\nare called conductors and most metals are conductors. On the other hand, atoms which\ndo not have free electrons and so they can't pass\nelectrons between other atoms are known as insulators. And these are things\nlike glass and rubber. Now, we can combine these materials to safely use electricity by having the conductor in the center, which allows electrons to move, but surround this with an insulator to restrict where they can flow to, i.e., not lead to us, which keeps us safe. If we look inside a slice of copper cable at the free electrons\nsurrounding the nucleus of the copper atom, you'll\nsee that the free electrons are able to move to other atoms, but this happens randomly\nin any direction. If we then connect this\nslice of copper cable to a closed circuit with a power source, such as a battery, then the\nvoltage will force the electrons to move and these will then all flow in the same direction to try and get back to the other terminal of the battery. When I say circuit,\nthis just means the root which electrons could flow along between the two terminals,\nthe positive and the negative, of a power source. So we can add things into their path, like light bulbs, and this\nmeans that the electrons will have to pass through\nthis in order to get to the other terminal. And so we can use this to\ncreate things such as light. The circuit can either be open or closed. In a closed circuit,\nthat means the electrons can flow around. And in an open circuit, this\nmeans that the electrons are not able to flow. Voltage is a pushing force of\nelectrons within a circuit. It's like pressure in a water pipe. The more pressure you have,\nthe more water can flow. The more voltage you have,\nthe more electrons can flow. But what does a volt mean? Well, a volt is a joule per coulomb. And a joule is a measurement\nof energy or work and a coulomb is a group\nof flowing electrons. We'll have a look at what a coulomb is in just a second though. So a nine volt battery\ncan provide nine joules of energy in the form of work or heat per group of electrons that flow from one side of the battery to the other. In this case, the current of electrons flow from one side of the battery through the LED light\nbulb, which produces light, and then the electrons\nflow to the other side of the battery, therefore,\nnine joules of light and heat is produced by the light bulb. Current is the flow of electrons. When a circuit is closed, it means electrons can flow,\nand when the circuit is open, no electrons will flow. We can measure the flow of electrons just like you can measure the\nflow of water through a pipe. To measure the flow of electrons, we use the unit of amp. One amp means one coulomb per second and one coulomb is a group of electrons. The group is incredibly\nlarge and is approximately six billion, 242 million,\nbillion electrons, and that has to pass in one second for it to equal one amp. That's why electrons are grouped together and just called amps, to\nmake it easier for engineers. Resistance is a restriction\nto the flow of electrons in a circuit. The wire which carries the electrons will naturally have some resistance. The longer the wire, the\ngreater the resistance. The thicker the wire,\nthe lower the resistance. Resistance to the flow of electrons is different for each material. And the temperature of the material can also change resistance\nto the flow of electrons. Electrical circuits use\nspecially designed components known as resistors to\npurposely restrict the flow of electrons. This is either to protect other components from too many electrons flowing through it or it can also be used\nto create light and heat, such as in an incandescent light bulb. Resistance occurs when\nelectrons collide with atoms. The amount of collisions is\ndifferent from one material to another. Copper has very low collision rate, but other materials such as iron will have much more collisions. When collisions occur,\nthe atoms generate heat and at a certain temperature, the material will then\nstart to produce light as well as heat, which is how\nthe incandescent lamps work. When a wire is wrapped in a coil, it will generate a magnetic field as the current passes through it. The cable will naturally\ncreate electromagnetic field by itself. It's just intensified by the coil. By wrapping it in a coil, the magnetic field becomes so strong that the magnetic field starts to actually affect the electrons within the wire. But we'll look at why this occurs in a future, more advanced video. We can increase the strength\nof the magnetic field simply by wrapping the\ncoils around an iron core. We can also increase the number\nof turns within the coils and also we can increase\nthe amount of current passing through the circuit. And this is how electromagnets work and it's also the base of\nhow induction motors work. If you want to learn more\nabout induction motors, we've already covered this\nin another video already. Just see the link on the screen now. And when a magnetic field\npasses across the coil of wire, it will induce a voltage in that wire caused by an induced electromotive force, which is pushing electrons\nin a certain direction. If the wire is connected in a circuit, then this electromotive force\nwill cause a current to flow. This is the basis of\nhow AC generators work and the electricity at your\nwall sockets within your home is produced in a very similar way. Transformer, now, we can\ncombine all of the aspects together that we've just covered and when we do so, we will\nsee that we can use one coil to generate electricity and then we can place two other coils in very close proximity to\neach other but not touching, and this will create a transformer. The transformer will induce a voltage from the first of the primary coil over into the secondary coil. And this will force electrons to flow if the coil in the secondary side has a closed circuit. Now what's important about the transformer is that we can increase\nor decrease the voltage between the primary\nand the secondary coils simply by changing the amount\nof coils on either side. Again, this is a subject all by itself so we'll cover this in a\nmore advanced video later on. Now, something else which I\njust want to briefly mention is the capacitor. So, a capacitor forces\npositive and negative charges to separate across two plates when it is connected to a power supply. This causes a build-up\nor store of electrons within an electric field. When the power supply\nis cut or interrupted, these charges will then be released, flow up, and meet again. This provides a power source\nbut only for a few seconds until the charges have\npaired back up again. It's slightly similar to a battery, but capacitors are very common and they're in almost\nevery single circuit board. We'll cover this obviously in more detail in a future video. Just be aware of these. So the last part I want\nto cover in this video is that there are two types\nof current electricity. That being alternating current, or AC, and then direct current, or DC. Alternating current simply means that the current flows\nbackwards and forwards in a circuit as the terminals\nare constantly reversed. This is a bit like the tide of the sea. It goes in and out, in\nand out, in and out. So there is reversing constantly. Now, alternating current\nis the most common source of power and the plug\nsockets in your homes, in your buildings, in schools,\nand work places, et cetera, these will all be providing\nalternating current, AC. Now, on the other hand, we've\ngot direct current, or DC, and that simply means\nthat the current flows directly in only one direction. It is not alternating. This is what's provided from batteries and almost all your handheld devices are from this, as well. So we can convert AC to DC and vice versa using power electronics. And this is how we charge and power, you know, small devices, and it's also how solar panels can be used to power our homes. Because solar panels produce DC power and our homes need AC power. So we have to convert\nthis for it to be usable. So both AC and DC have\npros and cons to it, but, you know, for sure we'll look at this in another later video. It's a bit more advanced. And there's also quite\nan interesting history behind why we use AC, DC, and\nthe inventors behind that. If you've got 10 minutes,\nI definitely recommend having a Google or a YouTube of this, too. All right, that's it for this video. Thank you very much for watching. I hope you enjoyed this and it helped you. If you have any questions, please leave me in the\ncomments section below.

                    "transcript": "[Music] How do we get around from place to place\nwithout having to walk everywhere? How can we communicate\nwith people who live far away? These were problems that people struggled \nwith for a long time, until recently. Before there were things like cars,\nand phones, and computers. And you know who solved those problems? Engineers. But do you know what an engineer is? [Music] The short answer is that an engineer is someone\nwho wants to know how and why things work. Now, I want to know how and why things work, but does that make me an engineer? Not quite. Besides being naturally curious, an engineer is a person who \ndesigns and builds things like machines or systems, or structures, \nthat help solve a specific problem. There's more than just one type of engineer, too. But no matter what type of engineer someone is, they have to ask themselves three very\nimportant questions when they're working. Number 1: What is the problem that needs to be solved? Number 2: Who has the problem that needs to be solved? And most importantly, number 3: Why is this problem important to solve? Let's take a look at some examples. [Music] A really famous example of engineering is the\nGolden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. I mentioned that there are\ndifferent kinds of engineers, and the civil engineer is someone who designs\nand constructs buildings, roads and, yep, bridges. For the person who designed\nthe Golden Gate Bridge, what was the problem\nthat they needed to solve? People couldn't travel in\nor out of San Francisco, which is surrounded on most\nsides by water, without a boat. Who had the problem? Residents of San Francisco, mostly,\nbut really anybody traveling in the area. And why was the problem important to solve? Well you didn't want a whole bunch of San Fransisco \nresidents trapped in San Fransisco forever. Even if it's a super cool city. Plus you wanted people outside of San Fransisco  to be able to travel to the \ncity easily if they needed to. So the Golden Gate Bridge was engineered\nas a solution to this problem. In addition to civil engineers,\nthere are also mechanical, electrical, chemical, computer,\nnuclear, and software engineers. And the list goes on. Let's talk about what some of\nthe other types of engineers do. First up, electrical engineers. Electrical engineers study electricity. They design electrical systems like\ncircuits and computer chips. Think of an electrical object\nthat you use pretty regularly. How about your microwave? What problem was the microwave a solution to? Cold food, right? You have an electrical engineer to thank for the ability to reheat that leftover\npizza you just had for lunch. But while you might not have heard of\nJoseph Strauss or Percy Spencer, the engineers responsible for the Golden\nGate Bridge and the microwave respectively, You`ve probably heard of Henry Ford. As in Ford cars. Henry Ford was a mechanical engineer, or\nsomeone working in a manufacturing industry, making mechanical things like\ntools, engines and machines. Machines like cars. Ford didn`t invent the automobile, but his Ford Motor Company made a lot of them. His Model T car was famous for being\naffordable for plenty of Americans. Ford saw that lots of people who\nwanted to drive cars, just couldn't. Because they couldn`t afford the\npricey vehicles that were for sale. So he engineered a cheaper model\nas a solution to this problem. His fellow engineers started to do the\nsame and now, well, cars are everywhere. Henry Ford was not the only big-name engineer. A famous engineer around today is Marissa Mayer. Mayer is the president of the\ninternet company Yahoo, and is also a software engineer. Software engineers work on computers\nand other products that use software to write programs to make them\nfaster and able to do more things. [Music] No matter what kind of engineer someone is, their job at its most basic\nlevel is problem-solving. Each engineer just specializes in\nsolving certain kinds of problems. While it might seem like there are too\nmany types of engineers to keep track of, just wait 15 years, or 50, or 100. Because we will probably have a ton of\ndifferent types to add to the list by then. Think about it. Over 100 years ago we didn't have jobs \nin fields like aerospace engineering, where people design and construct\nplanes and spacecraft. We didn`t have planes like we\ndo today, or need spaceships. So we didn`t need people to engineer them. Who knows what machines or tools or everyday \nobjects we will have in the year 3015? Personally, I`m hoping for underwater cities. But whatever these things are,\nwe will need engineers to make them. So what do you say? Who wants to be an engineer? [Music]"

                    "transcript": "Do you ever wonder how amorphous lumps of\nmaterial are turned into the everyday products which surround us?! Let's find out! In this video we're going to talk\nabout manufacturing processes. There are six main categories of manufacturing\nprocesses, which are forming, casting, moulding, joining, machining, and additive manufacturing. Each one of these categories contains a large\nnumber of different manufacturing techniques. There are a lot of different factors which\nneed to be considered when selecting the right manufacturing process. This includes the material you are working\nwith, the geometry of the object, the number of parts you are producing, tool and material costs, and required levels of automation, to name just a few. Let’s look through each of the six categories in detail. Forming involves applying forces or pressure\nand plastically deforming the material to produce the desired shape. It is typically used for metals. Most forming processes can be done when the\nmetal is either above or below its recrystallization temperature. This is known as hot or cold working. Hot working makes it is easier to plastically\ndeform the metal. But cold working causes strain hardening,\nwhich increases the strength of the material. Three common forming processes are forging,\nrolling and extrusion. Modern forging is done using machines. In closed die or impression forging, the metal\nis placed between top and bottom closed dies. Repeated strokes from the hammer are used\nto cause the metal to flow into the shape of the dies. Objects produced using forging can have improved\nmechanical properties compared to objects which are cast. But it can be difficult to achieve tight tolerances\nusing forging, and the required equipment can be expensive. Extrusion is a continuous process which involves\nplacing hot metal in a chamber and using a ram to force it through a die, producing a\nlong object with a constant cross-section. Extrusion provides an excellent surface finish\nand can achieve very tight tolerances, but it is only suitable for producing two-dimensional shapes. Rolling is probably the most commonly used\nforming process. It involves passing metal between two or more\nrollers which apply pressure and reduce thickness. More complex products like I-beams can also\nbe manufactured by rolling. Rolling can result in improved mechanical\nproperties, and can be automated, which makes it good for large scale production. But tooling costs tend to be high and it can’t\nbe used to produce very complex shapes. Let’s move on to the next category of manufacturing\nprocesses - Casting. Casting involves pouring molten metal into\na mold and allowing it to solidify. It is what we call a primary shaping process. A secondary process such as machining is typically\nneeded to achieve the desired surface finish. Like forming, casting is most commonly used\nfor metals. Three common types of casting are die casting,\nsand casting and investment casting. In die casting, molten metal is forced into\nreusable metal dies at high pressure. Once the molten metal has solidified, it is\nremoved from the mold. Die casting is mostly used for non-ferrous\nmetals like aluminum and zinc, which have low melting temperatures. It provides an excellent surface finish, and\ncan achieve very tight tolerances, but start-up costs tend to be high, so it is only really\nsuitable for large production runs. In sand casting, a pattern is used to create\na single-use mold from damp sand. The sand is typically contained in two mold\nboxes called the cope and the drag. Molten metal is poured into the mold through\na channel formed in the sand. When the metal has solidified the cast object\ncan be removed from the sand. Sand casting can be used for a wide range\nof metals, including those with high melting temperatures. It can produce large and complex parts, and\ninitial costs are very low, making it good for small production runs. However it provides a poor surface finish,\nand is not as accurate as other casting processes. The last casting process we will look at is\ninvestment casting. Several wax patterns of the same object are\ncreated and attached to a sprue. The wax tree is dipped into a slurry to create\na ceramic mold. Heat is applied to melt out the wax. Molten metal is then poured into the ceramic  mold, and once the casting has cooled the mold is broken off. Investment casting is good for parts with\ncomplex geometry, and can achieve tight tolerances. But it is an expensive and time consuming process. Molding is very similar to casting. It involves shaping a liquid or pliable material\nusing a mold. Most of the time molding is used for forming plastics. Typical molding processes are injection molding,\ncompression molding and blow molding. Let’s look at the first two. Injection molding is the most commonly used\nmanufacturing method for plastics. Polymer granules are fed into the hopper and\na screw is used to pass the material through a heated cylinder, before it is forced at\npressure into the mold. Injection molding is mostly used for thermoplastics,\nwhich are polymers which soften when they are heated and harden when they are cooled. It is a very fast process, and can be fully\nautomated, meaning labor costs are low. But start-up costs are very high, due to the\nexpensive molds, so it is really only cost-effective for large production runs. Compression molding involves placing a precise\namount of material into a mold. The mold is closed and pressure and temperature\nare applied. Compression molding is mostly used for thermosets,\nwhich are polymers which irreversibly harden when heated. Tooling costs are relatively cheap, making\nit good for small production runs, but it is quite a slow process and is not well suited\nfor complex designs. So far we have only looked at material deformation\nprocesses. Machining is a material removal process, where\na tool is used to remove material from a larger object. It is often used for secondary shaping, when\nthe part has already been formed using a primary process like casting. Machining can be used for a wide range of\nmaterials, including metals, plastics and wood. Examples of machining include drilling, turning\nand reaming. Drilling is the cutting of a normal circular\nhole by pressing a rotating drill bit through a solid object. And turning is the use of a cutting tool to\nshape a rotating workpiece. Let’s move on to the next category. Joining involves combining multiple separate\ncomponents into a larger assembly. Like machining, joining is a secondary process. Welding, riveting, brazing, soldering and\nfastening are all different types of joining processes. Welding uses extremely high heat to fuse distinct\nmetal parts together. Unlike soldering and brazing, the base metal\nmelts during welding. The final category is Additive Manufacturing,\nwhich involves adding material to build up the desired object, typically one layer at a time. 3D printing, selective laser sintering and\nvat polymerization are examples of additive manufacturing techniques. For 3D printing a computer is used to successfully\nbuild up an object layer by layer. 3D printing is a slow process and the range\nof materials which can be used is limited. As a result it tends to be used for prototyping\nrather than for mass production. That’s it for this introduction to\nmanufacturing processes! Please leave a comment to let me know what you think!

This is only possible because cleverly designed\nmachines like this pulley system are able to amplify forces in some way. The amplification of a force is called mechanical\nadvantage, and we can quantify the amount of mechanical advantage a specific system\ncan generate as the force that is output by the system divided by the input force. To illustrate this consider a mass of 100 kg. To lift it off the ground you need to apply\na force of around 1 kN. But if you use a device with a mechanical\nadvantage of 2, you only need to input a 0.5 kN force. To explain how this is even possible, this\nvideo will take a look at three devices - levers, pulleys and gears - that are able to do just that. I've also covered a fourth way of generating\nmechanical advantage, using hydraulic systems, in a companion video that you can watch\nright now over on Nebula. The best way to get access to Nebula is by signing up to our bundle deal with this video's sponsor CuriosityStream, but more about that later. Let's start with the lever. Consisting of just a beam pivoting about a\nfixed hinge, called the fulcrum, it's one of the simplest ways of generating mechanical\nadvantage. Consider the amount of force we need to balance\na mass located at one end of the beam. When discussing levers it’s common to talk\nabout a load, which in this case is the mass, and an effort, which is the force that needs\nto be applied to lift the load. It’s quite obvious that this system with\nthe fulcrum in the middle of the beam can only be balanced if the effort is equal to\nthe load. But what if we move the fulcrum away from\nthe centre of the beam, towards the mass? We now only need a much smaller effort to\nbalance the lever. But why? We can explain this by considering the rotational\nstability of the lever. Both the load and the effort have the effect\nof rotating the lever, which means that they are generating moments about the fulcrum. A moment is a quantity that determines how\nmuch a force causes something to rotate about a specific point. It is calculated as the magnitude of the force\nmultiplied by the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the point\nof interest. For the lever to be in rotational equilibrium\nthe moments acting about the fulcrum must balance each other. We can then easily calculate how large the\neffort needs to be to balance the load, based on the distances a and b. Earlier we defined mechanical advantage as\nthe ratio of the output to the input force, so we can see that for a lever it is calculated\nas the ratio of the two distances. By moving the fulcrum we can change the mechanical\nadvantage. Putting it very close to the load means we\nwill be able to lift the mass with a much smaller force, which is incredibly useful. It might seem like the lever is somehow breaking\nthe laws of physics, by turning a small force into a much larger one. But it’s important to remember that levers\ndon’t actually create energy. The amount of energy used to lift a mass is\nequal to the magnitude of the applied force multiplied by the distance over which the\nforce acts. So although the force applied to lift the\nmass when using mechanical advantage is smaller, it needs to be applied over a longer distance. The amount of energy used is always the same,\nwith or without mechanical advantage. All devices that generate mechanical advantage\nwork on this same principle -  they convert a small force applied over a long distance\ninto a large force applied over a short distance. The pulley, which is essentially just a wheel\ncontaining a groove through which a rope or cable can run, is a bit more difficult to\nunderstand than the lever, but opens up even more possibilities for generating mechanical\nadvantage. Let’s look at a simple configuration where\na rope is passed through a single pulley and is attached to a mass. If a large enough force is applied to the\nend of the rope, the mass can be lifted. This system allows us to re-direct the force\nneeded to lift the mass, so that we can pull on the rope at an angle instead of having\nto lift the mass vertically off the ground, but it doesn’t actually provide any mechanical\nadvantage - if the mass has a weight of 1 kN, a 1 kN force has to be applied to the\nend of the rope to lift it. Because the rope is being pulled on by the\napplied force at one end, and by the weight of the mass at the other, it's subjected to\na tensile load of 1 kN along its entire length. In reality a slightly larger force will need\nto be applied to compensate for friction at the pulley, but to keep things simple we'll\nassume that the pulley is both frictionless and massless. Let’s look at a different setup now, where\nthe pulley is flipped upside down and is attached to the mass instead of the ceiling. This small modification completely changes\nhow the system works - it might seem impossible but we now only need to apply half the force\nwe previously did to lift the mass. This system has a mechanical advantage of 2. The reason is that the mass is now supported\nby two segments of rope, instead of just one. To better understand what's happening let's\ntake a look at the forces acting on the pulley. There is one downwards force, the weight of\n1 kN, and two upwards forces caused by the two parts of the same rope that are supporting the pulley. The tension in the rope is constant along\nits length, so the two upwards forces must be equal to each other. And for the system to be in equilibrium they\nmust balance the 1 kN load. We can conclude that both upwards forces are\nequal to 0.5 kN. Since half of the load is taken by the ceiling,\nthe load can be lifted by applying a force of only 0.5 kN to the end of the rope. To make this system slightly easier to use,\nwe can add a second pulley so that instead of pulling up on the free end of the rope\nwe can pull on it at an angle. Like with the lever, the cost of dividing the\nforce needed to lift the mass by 2 is that we have to apply that force over a double the distance. The additional distance comes from the fact\nthat two segments of the rope need to be shortened to raise the mass, instead of just one. Adding even more pulleys allows us to achieve\ngreater mechanical advantage. This system has a mechanical advantage of\nfour, for example. The mass is supported by 4 rope segments so\nproducing an output force of 1 kN only requires an input force of 0.25 kN. Because using this many pulleys takes up a\nlot of space, the individual pulleys are usually combined into two blocks, one movable block\nthat moves with the mass, and one standing block that is fixed to the ceiling. Gears are another type of simple machine that\ngenerates mechanical advantage. The teeth of one gear interlock with identical\nteeth on another to form gear trains that can be used to transmit and multiply forces. In each set of gears we can identify a driver\ngear that’s connected to a motor or a rotating shaft and transmits force to a follower gear,\ncausing it to rotate in the opposite direction. In this case the follower gear, which has\n20 teeth, is smaller than the driver gear, which has 40 teeth. Since the circumference of the larger gear\nis twice that of the smaller gear, the smaller gear must rotate twice for every one rotation\nof the large gear. This configuration is called a speed multiplier\n- the follower gear is rotating twice as fast as the driver gear. To understand how gears can generate mechanical\nadvantage let’s look at how force is transmitted through the system. This motor provides a torque of 100 Nm to the driver gear. Torque is a moment that acts about a longitudinal\naxis, and is calculated as the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance to the\naxis of rotation. The torque of 100 Nm is equivalent\nto someone turning the shaft with a force of 100 N at a distance of 1 m, or\na force of 200 N at a distance of half a metre, for example. The input torque causes the driver gear to\nrotate, generating a tangential contact force between the two gears. We can calculate the magnitude of the contact\nforce as the input torque divided by the distance between the force and the axis of rotation,\nwhich is just the radius of the driver gear. The contact force causes the follower gear\nto rotate, generating an output torque that can be calculated as the product of the contact\nforce and the radius of the follower gear. This tells us that the mechanical advantage\nof the system is given by the ratio of the radii of the two gears. This is the same as the number of teeth on\nthe follower gear divided by the number of teeth on the driver gear. With 40 teeth on the driver gear and 20 on\nthe follower gear, this particular system has a mechanical advantage of 0.5. Doubling the speed of the follower gear comes\nat the cost of halving the output torque. But if the smaller gear is the driver gear,\nthe system will have a mechanical advantage of 2 - the output speed is halved but the\noutput torque is double the input torque. Even when a system has more than two gears\nthe mechanical advantage only depends on the number of teeth on the first and last gears. This means a third gear, called an idler gear,\ncan be added to make the driver and follower gears turn in the same direction, without\naffecting the mechanical advantage of the system. Using a small driver gear to turn a large\nfollower gear and generate large torques is how a hand winch works. A drum around which a cable is wound is attached\nto the large follower gear, and the small gear is driven by turning a handle. The larger number of teeth on the follower\ngear means that the input torque from the handle is amplified, allowing heavy objects\nto be moved by the winch. Levers, pulleys and gears aren't the only\ndevices that can amplify forces. Hydraulic systems, like you would find in\na hydraulic press for example, use the incompressibility of liquids to generate mechanical advantage, which makes\nthem useful for applications like the deployment of landing gear in aircraft flight control\nsystems. If you're interested in learning more I've\njust published a video on Nebula that goes into the detail of how exactly hydraulic systems\nare able to generate mechanical advantage, and the different components you need to build\na functioning one.

They allow us to create strong structures\nwhile using materials in a very efficient and cost-effective way. So what exactly is a truss? It is essentially a rigid structure made up\nof a collection of straight members. But that's not a complete definition. There are two important assumptions we need\nto be able to make for a structure to be considered as a truss. First, we need to be able to assume that all\nof the joints in the structure can be represented by a pinned connection, meaning that members\nare free to rotate at the joints. The members of a truss are often rigidly connected\nusing what is known as a gusset plate, but if the centre-lines of all of the members\nat a joint intersect at the same point, like they do here, it's reasonable to assume that\nthe joint behaves like a pinned connection. The second assumption we need to be able to\nmake is that loads are only ever applied at the joints of the truss. We never have loads acting in the middle of\na member, for example. Because all joints are pinned, the members\ncannot carry bending moments - they can only carry axial loads. This simplifies the analysis of\na truss significantly. Each member has to be in equilibrium, so the\nforces acting at each end of a member must be equal and opposite. Each member is either in tension or in compression. These assumptions are what differentiate a\ntruss from a frame. Unlike trusses, frames don't necessarily have\npinned joints, and so members can carry  bending moments. A frame can also have loads applied directly\nto its members. The base shape of a truss is three members\nconnected to form a triangle. If a load is applied, the angles of the triangle\nwon't be able to change if the length of each of the members stays the same. This means that the triangle is a very stable\nshape which won't deform when loads are applied to it, and so it is a great base from which\nto build a larger structure. Joining four members together does not form\na stable structure. The angles between members can change without\nany change in the length of the members, and so using a four-sided shape as the base for\nbuilding a truss would be a terrible choice. An easy way to stabilize this configuration\nis to add a diagonal bracing member to split it into triangles. We can start with our triangle and build it\nout to form a structure. There are a lot of different ways to build\na truss, but there are some particularly popular truss designs that you will see again and\nagain, and so they are referred to by specific names. The one shown here is a Fink roof truss, but\nthere are many more, as you can see here. Later on in this video I'll cover how these\ndifferent designs carry loads in different ways. The members of these trusses are all located\nin the same plane. These are called planar trusses, and we can\nanalyse them as two-dimensional structures. Even seemingly three-dimensional structures\ncan often be analysed as planar trusses. Take a look at this bridge for example. The loads are transmitted from the horizontal\nfloor beams to the two vertical trusses on each side of the bridge. Each of these trusses only carries loads acting\nin its plane, and so we can analyse it as a two-dimensional structure. To be able to design or analyse a truss we\nneed to be able to determine the force in each of its members. This allows us to check that the members can\ncarry the loads without failing, or gives us the information we need to select the best\ncross-section for each of the members. There are two main methods we can use to do\nthis - the Method of Joints, and the Method of Sections. Let's look at the Method of Joints first,\nusing the Fink roof truss we saw earlier. The method is really simple. First you draw a free body diagram, showing\nall of the external loads acting on the truss, and you use the three equilibrium equations\nto calculate the reaction forces. Then you draw a free body diagram for every\nsingle joint, and work through them one by one to solve the unknown forces acting at\neach joint. You solve the unknown forces using the\nequilibrium equations. Since all of the joints are pinned connections,\nthere are no moments, and so you only need to consider equilibrium of the horizontal\nand vertical forces. Remember that we are calculating the forces\nacting at each joint, not the forces in the member. If a member is in tension, the internal forces\nwill be acting to make the member longer. For every action, there is an equal and opposite\nreaction, which means that a member in tension will be exerting a force on the joint which\nis acting away from the joint. For members in compression, the force will\nbe acting towards the joint. Let's work through an example for a slightly\nsimpler truss. First let's draw the free body diagram and\ndetermine the reaction forces using our three equilibrium equations. Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces,\nthe horizontal force at joint A must be equal to zero, because it is the only force in the\nhorizontal direction. Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces,\nthe reaction forces at joints A and E must sum up to 20 kN. Both joints are located at the same distance\nfrom joint C, so taking equilibrium of the moments acting about joint C we can calculate\nthat they both equal 10 kN. Now let's determine the forces acting on\neach joint. Since we don't know yet which members are\nin tension and which are in compression, it's easiest to just assume that all of the members\nare in tension, and so we'll draw the internal forces as pointing away from each joint. If we end up with negative values for these\nforces, it just means that we guessed wrong, and the member is actually in compression. Now we can work through each of the joints,\nstarting with joint A. Analysing trusses involves a lot of resolving\nforces to different angles, so if you want to be good at it you're going to need to remember\nyour trigonometry! Here's a quick reminder. Back to our joint... All we have to do is apply the equilibrium\nequations to determine the unknown forces at joint A. Taking equilibrium of the vertical forces,\nthe 10 kN reaction force must balance the vertical component of the force F-AB. And so we can calculate F-AB as -10\ndivided by sine of the angle of 60 degrees. Taking equilibrium of the horizontal forces,\nwe get that the force F-AC must balance the horizontal component of the force F-AB, and\nso is equal to 5.8 kN. That's all of the forces acting on joint A\ncalculated. The force in each member is constant, and\nso we now also know the forces acting on the joints at the other ends of these two members. We can then repeat the process for joint B. We can start by considering equilibrium of\nthe vertical forces, which allows us to calculate the force F-BC. And then we can consider equilibrium of the\nhorizontal forces to calculate F-BD. We then need to work through all of the remaining\njoints. But we can save a bit of time by noticing\nthat the truss and the applied loads have an axis of symmetry, and so the forces on\nthe other side of the truss must be identical. That gives us all of the forces at the joints. We can show which members are in tension and\nwhich are in compression, like this. One thing you'll notice as you analyze\ntrusses is that some members don't carry any loads at all. We call these zero force members. There are two main configurations where we\nhave zero force members. The first is where we have three members connected\nat a single joint, and two of the members are aligned. Here, only one member has a component in the\nvertical direction, and so to maintain equilibrium of forces at the joint in the vertical direction,\nthe force in this member must be zero. The second configuration is when we have only\ntwo members connected at a joint, and the members are not aligned. Only one member has a component in the vertical\ndirection, and so both must be zero force members. By the way, this is true regardless of how\nthe members are oriented, because we can rotate the orientation of the coordinate system we\nare using to apply the equilibrium equations. These two configurations only contain zero force\nmembers if there are no external loads acting at the joints. If we have external loads, there will be components\nin the vertical direction, and so these will not be zero force members. Let's look at an example. At this joint here, we have two connected\nmembers. The members are not co-linear, and there are\nno external loads, so they must be zero force members. And at this joint we have three members, of\nwhich two are co-linear. The vertical member must be a zero force member. We can remove these members, and so we have\na much easier starting point for solving the truss. You'll notice that we haven't removed the\ntwo members at this joint. That is because there is an external load\nacting here, and so these can't be zero force members. You might be wondering why anyone would bother\nincluding zero force members in a truss if they carry no loads. They are definitely not useless. They are usually included to provide stability,\nfor example to prevent buckling of long members which are under compression. Or they may be used to make sure that unexpected\nloads won't cause the structure to fail. We've covered the Method of Joints. Let's look at the other method we can use\nto solve trusses, which is the Method of Sections. The first step is the same as the Method\nof Joints. We draw the free body diagram, and use the\nequilibrium equations to solve the reaction forces. Next, we make an imaginary cut through the\nmembers of interest in our truss, and we draw the internal forces in the cut members. The internal and external forces must be in\nequilibrium, and so we can apply the equilibrium equations to solve the internal forces. When choosing how to cut your truss, remember\nthat we only have 3 equilibrium equations. If you cut through too many members, you will\nhave too many unknowns and not enough equations. You can choose which side of the cut you want\nto assess. The left side looks easier to solve because\nthere are less forces, but we could have chosen to solve the right side instead. The Method of Sections is best used when you\nhave a truss which has a lot of members, but you are only interested in the loading in\na few specific members. Let's look at an example. We need to determine the internal forces in\nthese three members. First let's draw the free body diagram and\napply the equilibrium equations to calculate the reaction forces. The horizontal reaction force at joint A is\nthe only force acting in the horizontal direction, so it must be equal to zero. By considering equilibrium of forces in the\nvertical direction, and equilibrium of the moments acting about joint A, we can figure\nout that F-A is equal to 19 and F-H is equal to 21. Next let's make our imaginary cut through\nmembers F-D, F-E and G-E, and draw the internal forces. Like we did earlier for the method of joints,\nwe will assume that all unknown forces are tensile. Next we just need to apply the equilibrium\nequations. The force in member F-E is the only unknown\nforce with a component in the vertical direction, so that's a good place to start. The diagonal members are all at 45 degree\nangles, so by considering equilibrium in the vertical direction we get that the force in\nmember F-E is equal to 12.7 kN. Now let's consider equilibrium of moments\nacting about joint F. This is a good joint to choose because 3 of\nthe 5 forces in this free body diagram have a line of action passing through F, and so\nonly the force in member G-E and the 21 kN reaction force generate a moment about this\njoint. Both forces are located at a distance of 2 m from F, and so we can conclude that the force in member G-E is equal to 21 kN. Finally, we can take equilibrium in the horizontal\ndirection to calculate that the force in member F-D is equal to -30 kN. And that's it, we've calculated the internal\nforces in the three members we were interested in. One member is in compression and two are in\ntension. If it is possible to determine the reaction\nforces and the internal forces in the members of a truss by applying the equilibrium equations,\nthe truss is said to be statically determinate. Real-life structures sometimes contain more\nmembers than are needed for the structure to be stable, as this makes them safer. This means we may not be able to apply the\nMethod of Joints or the Method of Sections, because we have too many unknowns and not\nenough equilibrium equations, either to determine the reaction forces, or to determine the internal\nforces within the truss. These trusses are said to be statically indeterminate,\nand would need to be solved using other methods like the force method or the displacement\nmethod, which I won't get into in this video. Now that we know how to calculate the loads\nin a truss, let's explore some of the differences between truss designs. Here we have three different bridge trusses,\nthe Howe, Pratt and Warren trusses. These trusses were all patented in the 1840s,\nat a time when new bridge designs were being developed to accommodate the expansion of\nthe railroad industry. They were typically constructed from a combination\nof wood and iron. We can learn a lot about truss design by figuring\nout which members are in tension and which are in compression. Let's start with the Howe truss. We can see that its vertical members are\nin tension, and its diagonal members are in compression. Members in compression usually need to be\nthicker than members in tension, to reduce the risk of buckling. This means that the Howe truss isn't very\ncost effective, since the diagonal members, which need to be thicker, are quite long. The Pratt truss addresses this issue. Its vertical members are mostly in compression\nand its inner diagonal members are in tension. This is more cost-effective than the Howe\ntruss, since the longer diagonal members can be thinner. Longer members are also more susceptible to\nbuckling under compressive loading than shorter ones, so it's a good idea for long members\nto be in tension. The design of the Warren truss was based on\nequilateral triangles. The fact that all of the members are the same\nlength is an advantage for construction, and it uses less members overall than the Howe\nand Pratt trusses, so it is more efficient. The diagonal members alternate between tension\nand compression, so it does have some quite long members in compression. It can also be interesting to observe how\nthe loading in members changes as a load moves across a bridge. In this simplified model of a load moving\nacross the Pratt bridge, we can see that some members alternate between tension and compression,\nand so will need to be designed accordingly. The three-dimensional bridge we looked at\nearlier could be assessed as a collection of planar trusses. But this won't be possible for all structures,\nand sometimes a truss will need to be assessed in three dimensions. This type of truss is called a space truss. These can be analysed in essentially the same\nway as planar trusses, using the Method of Joints and the Method of Sections. The only difference will be in the number\nof equilibrium equations. We will have 6 equations instead of 3, and at each joint we will have 3 equations instead of 2. That's it for now! Thanks for watching and, as always, please\nremember to subscribe!"

                    "transcript": "Hi, my name is (Brad S.) Penn State Chemical Engineering Graduate Year of 2005. Currently (worked) for (Las incorporated) and today we're gonna cover the topic of problem solving. Along with a little example. So now here we are back at the comfort of my office to talk about the topic of\nproblem solving. And this is a very good skill that you're going to use every day in the industry is a Chemical Engineer. Most of the time you're going to be\nsolving problems with either a process itself. So temperature, chemistry, how to\nmake the desired product or the process equipment. There's issue with a pump. The compressor, turban, what have you. Something's not working right. There's a\nproblem to solve. So what we'll discuss now is kind of a general problem-solving methodology I use and a basic flow chart that works you through solving a problem systematically, which is what we'll take a look at here next. So this is essentially the problem solving flow chart that I use and we'll talk about each one of these steps here real quickly. So Step 1 is to define the problem. That's nothing more than a brief statement of exactly what's wrong. Also, good to define criticality; Is it a\nsafety issue? Is the problem causing an issue that has production down for some\nreason that would get included into the problem statement as well. Step 2 is to do background research. Learn about the process or learn about the equipment that you're having issues with. Talk to some of the senior engineers, experts at the plant that have\nexperience with it. Look up manuals, research files, all that\ngood stuff to understand what should be going on. Next Step Number 3 is specified requirements. You have a problem. How should it be acting? What do you need to do to fix it? What's the end result or the goal that you're trying to achieve with the problem solution? Step 4: Brainstorm, evaluate, and choose the solution. So you come up with a whole list. Involve several team members from the site. Everybody who needs to be involved to list out root causes of what could be causing the problem. How to fix those root causes and what to\ngo after in order to fix the situation, which then moves in to develop a\nprototype the solution. So based on those lists of root causes, \npick whatever will fix the issue. Develop the prototype. Is it a new piece of equipment? Is it some process change adjusting a temperature? And prototype it and figure out how that's going to be implemented. Next Step 6 is to test the\nactual solution in real time in a plant. See if it solves the problem. See if it doesn't. If it works, then you're done. Move right on. Communicate the results to the pertinent plant members. If it doesn't work; if it\nfails completely or only partially works, it becomes kind of an (iterative) exercise\nback to all these other steps right here to arrive at a different prototype, a different test, a different solution. So sometimes this can be circular for\nquite some time until the definite root causes identified and you can move into\na successful solution. So that's the general basis and general\nflow chart for problem solving I use. Now let's take a look at an actual example. Here's our example problem. We have these particular pumps and we put these leak detection systems on the pump mechanical sealing housing. Mechanical seal being the device that holds the process fluid into the top as operates. We never had issues before, but ever since we put these in, the seals leaked all the time, which is rather unusual. So we did a whole lot of work. And we won't go over all this, but as you can see a lot of work went into the problem\nsolving investigation. Only at the end to find out a leakage rate of up to three milliliters per hour is acceptable for the seal. So the seals were leaking all the time,\nbut we never noticed it because the liquid evaporate right away. And now we have these nice leak detection systems on here, which are capturing the liquid. Not allowing it to evaporate and telling us that we have a leak all the time. So we had to solve the problem to account for the normal leakage rate for the seal. And we'll go take a look at how we did that quick next. Aright, here we are in the boiler room. Here is the pump in question. Here is the solution to the problem. In addition of the very small length of () that catch, normally (). What do we do? Out of this (vile), we drain the small amount of normal leakage out every shift. That's how we solved the problem. Sometimes it doesn't always have to be that complicated. I hope you enjoyed the video!"

I have a background\nin chemical engineering with a Ph.D. in electrochemistry and an IBM\nData Science Professional Certification. I have created this series of videos\non data science with the scope\nof applying them to STEM fields and more specifically,\nto chemical engineering. In this series of videos we will explore from the very basic topic of how computers\nwork to artificial intelligence, object oriented programming, data\nvisualization and data processing. I hope you enjoy these videos. Hi, welcome to Learn to program with Python examples. In these videos\nwe will see the basics of how computers perform calculations and logic\nusing binary code. Then we will learn\nhow we can program logic with pen and paper in a language\nagnostic way. Finally, we will test our learning with\na popular high level language, Python. The layout of this course is as follows We will learn how computers perform\ncalculations, and logic\nthen we will program with pen and paper. We will learn the roles of variables,\nloops, logic. We will see examples\nwhere we trace the logic. And finally,\nwe will implement these examples with Python, But why Python? Python is currently\none of the most popular languages with a relatively easy learning curve. Having said that,\nthis course is mainly language agnostic and Python\nis used to illustrate the examples I personally found this approach\nto be the best for mastering more than one language at the time. So let's get started There's an old Roman saying that nothing is new under the sun. In that sense. This shows a rough timeline\nof the evolution of computers. If you thought computers are modern era thing,\nthen I'm afraid you are wrong. Computers have been around for a long time\nand in many shapes and forms. It's only during the digital revolution\nthat we managed to make them cheap enough\nfor everyone to afford. One thing\nthat all modern computers have in common is that they manage the flow\nof an electrical current. But why? And how? To understand this, first,\nwe need to understand a little bit of mathematics,\nin particular, the binary system. Unlike the decimal system,\nwe all learn at school, binary uses\njust two numbers, zero and one. In this way zero and one are the same\nin both decimal and binary. But once we want to get to number two,\nthings get really different. If we want to represent two in binary,\nwe need to move to the next decade similar\nto when we go from nine to ten in decimal. So two becomes 10 or ten in binary. Three becomes one, one and four. Again, we need to move to the next decade,\nmaking it 100 and so on. Another example is the octal system. In the system the decade change happens\nwhen we reach past number eight. In the next section,\nwe will learn the connection between this numerical system and computers. In this section, we will talk about\nboolean logic and logic gates. A logic gate is an idealized model\nfor computing a Boolean function. A Boolean function performs\na logical operation on one or more binary inputs that produces\na single binary output. A boolean is a data type\nthat has one of two possible values, for example, true\nor false, 0 or 1 or current or no current. It is named after George Boole\nwho first defined and algebraic system of logic\nin the mid-19th century. Binary is particularly well-suited for Boolean functions\nas it only involves zero and one. Here are some basic Boolean operations. They follow the same logic as humans\nwhen making decisions. We will see an example of these\nafter we learn how transistors help implement Boolean operations\nusing electricity in an analogy of sorts to binary numbers Now, we will talk about rlogic gates\nand transistors. A transistor is basically like a gate bridge,\nlike the Tower Bridge in London. It can allow or block\nthe passage of electrical current through, depending on if the signal to lift\nthe bridge has been given or not. Modern computer\nmicrochip has several billion transistors in special configurations\nthat allow it to perform logic operations in logic gates by measuring the current\nthat is blocked or allowed through them. But how do they work? Let's see\nusing an example with the AND gate. Take this photo of one of my cats. If we want to ask the computer\nif the cat and the chair are both colour black, we need to use the AND logic gate. It would be something like this. From the left we get an electric current that can also be represented\nby a one in binary. We ask the question to the first\ntransistor \"is the cat black?\" If the resulting the boolean is true\nor one in binary, then another current flows\nthrough the transistor gate and the gate opens, allowing the first current\nthrough to the next transistor. The same process happens when we ask the colour of the chair\non the second transistor. Finally, on the right end,\nthe computer measures an electrical current signal, which is\ninterpreted as a one or true in Boolean. That way the computer arrives\nto the answer true to both questions. If one of the questions is not true,\nlike in the example below where we ask if the cat is white,\nthen the current gets blocked. At the round end of the setup\nThe computer measures no current at all, or a zero,\nwhich is interpreted as FALSE in boolean. That, in a nutshell,\nis how the AND Boolean gate operates. Other Boolean gates\noperate in a similar way, but explaining them is beyond the scope\nof this video. In this section we will learn how transistors, boolean\nlogic and binary all come together to allow us to program a computer. Computers are not so smart,\nas it turns out. They can basically only sum numbers and only zeros and ones. All other operations are defined\nas particular cases of summation. In the previous section,\nwe saw how we can create a basic electrical circuit using transistors\nto perform some logic and an AND gate. Modern microchips contain billions\nof these and even more complex circuits. But what if I tell you that logic can be\nexpressed as a summation too. These are\nthe basis of how a computer brain works. But to talk to it we need to speak to it\nin ones and zeros. That is known as machine code,\nand it is how we first started the program before high level languages\nlike Python even existed. These high level languages\nwere then created to aid us. They allow us to give instructions\nto a computer with something more similar to human language. Let's suppose\nwe want to sum zero plus one. Easy right? How about we do it with electricity? We can use an exclusive OR Boolean gate. This gate takes two Boolean arguments,\nand only if one of these arguments is true,\nor one in binary then it returns a true. This means that the computer reads at the\nend of the circuit an electrical current. If we want to sum zero plus one,\nthen we input zero at one of the inputs and one in the other,\nand the gate returns a one. This is equivalent\nto zero plus one equals one. What if we want to sum one plus one? Then we're moving into the next decade,\nthe binary system. Remember, one plus one is two in decimal and 10 in binary. We quickly see that the exclusive OR gate\nis not sufficient for this operation as it can only output one digit. This is where the electric circuits in our processing\nstart to get more complex. We can sort this out by adding an\nAND gate in parallel that would take the same inputs\nas the exclusive OR gate. The AND gate will only return one\nif and only if all the inputs are ones. Otherwise is zero. The exclusive OR, as before,\nwill only return one If one of the inputs is one. This way\nthe exclusive OR gives the first digit and the AND gate is the second digit\nthat moves the number to the next decade. The result then is 10, which is two in binary. This is relatively simple\nwhen we use integer numbers like one, two, three, four, etc. When we try these operations\nwith real numbers like 0.33 or Pi,\nthe story gets a little more complicated. It is for this reason that you will find\nthat in programming integer numbers and real numbers,\nalso known as floating point numbers, are treated differently. In the next video, we will learn\nabout imperative programming. We will also learn about variables FOR\nand IF loops, and how to trace back some basic algorithms to better understand\nthem. We will then program around\nthese algorithms using Python. So you then!"

These work fine for small- and medium-sized\nprojects, but what if we need to layout something big like a road, bridge, dam, or pipeline? Hey I’m Grady and this is Practical Engineering. Today we’re talking about one of the civil\nengineer’s most important companions, land surveyors, and we’re also going to try a\nlittle bit of surveying you can do at home. This video is sponsored by Blue Apron, more\non that later. Surveying is essentially the science of taking\nbig measurements, and you’ve probably seen these guys on the side of the road looking\nthrough fancy equipment on a tripod. Just about any civil engineering project starts\nwith a survey to determine the legal boundaries between parcels of property, the location\nof existing infrastructure, and the topography and slopes of the land. Humans have always had a penchant for building\nbig stuff which means surveying is career full of history and tradition. Behind every wonder of the ancient world was\nan ancient geometry nerd who laid out the angles and alignments during construction. Surveying is also how we created accurate\nmaps of the continents like the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, which took almost 70 years\nto complete. I personally think everyone should aspire\nto accomplish something in your life that can be prefixed with the words “great trigonometrical.” The ubiquitous tool for a survey is called\na theodolite, and it’s one job is to measure the angles between two\npoints. Combine those angles with distances from a\nchain or tape measure, and you can triangulate the location of any point using trigonometry. Modern theodolites, called total stations,\ncan not only measure angles, but distance as well, and they have on-board computers\nto do the calculations and record the data for later use. When you see a surveyor peering through a\nfunny telescope, it’s probably a total station, and he or she is probably sighting a reflector\nto record the location of a point. That’s just scratching the surface of sophistication\nwith modern surveying equipment. With GPS and unmanned aircraft, things can\nget a lot more complicated. But I’ve got a few ways you can do your\nown topographic survey with fairly basic and inexpensive tools. Maybe you’ve got a drainage issue on your\nland, maybe you’re planning a landscaping project, or maybe you just want to exercise\nyour god-given right to take measurements of stuff and write those measurements down\non a clipboard. That’s my kind of recreational activity. My goal is to perform a leveling survey of\nmy front and back yard, which is just a way to get the relative topography for an area. I laid out a grid of points on a map of my\nhouse and then transferred those points to real life using pin flags. Now I just need to pick my datum or base point\nand measure the relative difference in height between that point and all the others. I tried a few ways to do this and there are\nno sines, cosines, or tangents required. First, a sight level which is essentially\na combination of a telescope and a spirit level. To use it, first get a buddy or a willing\nspouse to hold a surveying rod on the point of interest. Now, look through the sight at a surveying\nrod and raise or lower the end until the bubble is centered on the line. Once it’s centered you know that you’re\nlooking at a point that is exactly level to your eyes. Simply subtract the height of your eyeline\nwith the height measured on the rod and that’s your elevation. It’s not a precision technique, but it is\ncheap and simple which the most you can usually hope for in any part of a home improvement\nproject. The next way I tried is a water level which\nis literally just a length of clear vinyl tubing filled with a liquid. As long as there are no bubbles or kinks in\nthe line, the free surface at each end of the tube will self-level. I kept one end at my datum a fixed height\nand measure the height of the water at the other end as I carry it around to each of\nmy points. It’s a little more unwieldy but it does\nhave a distinct advantage, no line of sight required. You can use this method around corners or\nbehind trees with no problem, and again, it’s a cheap and simple solution. The third method to take a level survey worked\nbest for me: my laser level. Here’s the thing: I really like lasers. I relish any chance I get to use them in a\nconstructive way, and this is perfect. The laser level creates a perfect horizontal\nline that can be used to line up cabinets or tile, but it is also easy read on a surveying\nrod. You don’t need a helper, but you do probably\nneed to wait until dusk unless your laser is really bright, or you have these sweet\nlaser enhancement glasses. This isn’t the cheapest solution for a DIY\nland survey, but it is the fastest one I tried, and it’s a tool a lot of people already\nhave. Surveying is one of the oldest careers in\nthe world, and also one of the most important. Why? Because land is important. If you own some, it’s probably your most\nvaluable asset, and even if you don’t, you're pretty much stuck to it no matter where you\ngo. As a career, surveying is a fascinating mix\nof legal knowledge, field work, and technical challenges. And since most civil structures are too big\nfor conventional measurement tools, the surveyor is one of the most important companions for\nthe civil engineer.

                    "transcript": "Transcriber: Soumya Satheesan\nReviewer: Denise RQ Thank you very much, everyone. I stared civil engineering\nthree years ago, here at Imperial, and it's been a hell of a ride. It's really been very enriching, because I have to trust\nthat when I graduate in a year, if there's a graduate out there\nwho'll be able design a bridge that's going to work\nand not kill everyone that goes on it, it's going to be me and the people\nwho graduate with me. And that's a really exciting prospect. It's also a little bit daunting. The great thing about being here\nand learning these things is that it's a fantastic learning curve. It's something that I truly believe in. When I came into the lecture theater\nI've spent most of my life in - you probably will have one,\nlecture theater 201 - I was powered by that very prospect:\nthe prospect that everyday I was going to be adding on\nto this four-year learning curve, and I was going to be getting\nall this great new knowledge. I got so interested in\nkeeping up with this process that I didn't have time to look back. Recently I thought, \"Let's look back\nat what's happened every few years and see how I've grown along this really long engineering\nlearning curve.\" The reality is that it's been a lot harder\nfor me than I thought it would be, because when I left home, I put all of my stuff\nin the back of my parents' car, and I drove to university. But when I got here, there have been instances\nwhere I felt genuinely out of place, genuinely unhappy,\nwhich was really surprising to me because engineering was\nwhat I felt I was made for. I decided to try and understand\nwhy I was feeling this. I, as you heard, am Franco-Australian and I went to an international school\nin the suburbs of Paris. I was being taught\nin French and English all the time. I was surrounded by people\nwho were just like me, who were interested\nin lots of different things and were studying\nlots of different topics. We were all jumping from different topics\nthat we were interested in not because we had short attention spans\nor we all had ADHD or something, but because we had a genuine interest\nin a wide variety of topics. We were encouraged to pursue them. I fitted right into that environment.\nI found that that was home. When I left high school\nand I came to university, I brought that model along with me. And so when I got here -\nyou probably all know freshers fair - as a first year I was really excited. I signed up for as many things as I could. I was getting emails left and right.\nI joined lots of different clubs. And I was really busy first year.\nI was having a whale of a time. I was meeting lots of great people, but through these societies,\nso I had common interests with them. I thought I was meeting them because\nwe were all doing many different things. It turned out it took me\neight months to realize that not only was nobody else\nthat I knew doing this but a lot of people in my year\nthought that I was a bit of a freak. (Laughter). I even heard a guy tell me that I was this weird guy\nthat wasn't in the right course, that he wasn't supposed to be an engineer,\nbut he was sticking around probably because his parents\nwere pushing him to get a degree. So as long as he was going to\nbe here for four years, he might as well focus on doing\nother things than work when he could. That really resonated with me,\nbecause I was like, \"Hang on, why?\" I tried talking to them and advocating\nfor and cultivating these other interests, and I just kept hitting a wall. It's not that they were boring people. It's just they wanted to do their work, and they were open to doing\none sport activity and maybe another club, as long as it wasn't too much of a hassle not too much involvement,\nnot too much work. But I thought that my Model United Nations\ndebating platform was as important, which is something I'm still active in\nas my finite element analysis lecture. I was the only one to think that. It started getting to me that maybe I'm a little bit wrong,\nand maybe they are right. Maybe the role of an engineer\nis not necessarily this open, because we do have a great responsibility. When you think about it, when a surgeon makes a mistake,\nhe kills the patient that's in front. When an engineer makes a mistake,\nhe can kill a lot of people in one go. There is that responsibility,\nso maybe we should focus on making sure we have a technical base,\nand we never get it wrong. I started hitting a bit of a low point, and wondering what I had lived so far,\nand what I was living here. It was a little bit of a rock bottom;\nthe sky was a little bit cloudy. But you know how life is. Life has a way of throwing things\nat you from time to time. I got a phone call from my dad\nwho had just heard about this summit. It was taking place in Pittsburgh in the\nUS. It was called the One Young World. There were lots of really\ninteresting great leaders, from this current generation,\ngreat thinkers, great speakers who were going to\ntalk to [1,300] young people. These young people were selected\nfor the work they do all around the world. We were going to bring them together\nover a platform of six different topics, with debating and sharing, and that's how you would get\nthe new generation to start doing things. I was like, \"Yup, this is for me;\nthis is right up my alley.\" I took a week off of lectures first year,\nwhich is a big thing to do, and I went to this summit. Actually, it's the beginning\nof second year now. I'm giving my thinking one last chance. I had an incredible time. I met 1,300 of the most creative, most hard working,\nmost innovative people you've ever met. Also, there were lots of great speakers. We had President Clinton come\nand give the opening address, and no one told me\nthat Clinton was coming. So I just sat in the opening ceremony,\nand they say at some point, \"Please welcome Mr. Clinton.\" I'm like, \"Oh, that's funny!\nI know of a president called Clinton.\" Then I look up, and the actual guy\ncame up on stage. At that point, I just kept smiling\nfor half an hour. My facial expression didn't change at all.\nAnd it was just him speaking. We were all really encouraged and inspired\nfor the entire four days of the debate, because these were people who saw\nthe world in a way that I saw it, who believed\nin this Model UN coming together, anyone from any background, and sharing\nno matter what your experience is, and coming up with one resolution. I came back from this summit\nfully engaged, and what I realized afterwards was that I didn't meet\na single other engineer there - not one. I went back to my lecture theater with all my peers who thought\nI was a little bit weird, convinced that I belonged\nin that lecture theater, because I came back with the belief\nthat you're an engineer not because you have a grade\nthat says you have the right percentage; you're one because you're passionate\nabout people and the environment, and about bringing those together\nin a sustainable and durable way. We need to think about engineering\nlike this a little bit more. We need to make two changes to the way\nwe think and incorporate engineers. The first one is society needs\nto welcome them a little bit more, because if you think about it,\nbeing an engineer is hard. There's also the reality that engineers\nare not putting themselves out there much. They're not that passionate about that. The reasoning behind it is the engineer\nis focused on the technical background. When you think about it, a lot of society\nthinks of engineering as a bubble. If you ever had to work with an engineer, you talk to them when you want\nthem to build something, fix something. Then he comes in,\nhe designs something, he builds it, and then he moves on to the next project. There isn't much sharing there. We have a vision of engineering as this one big silo\nthat's completely isolated. The engineering professionals\nare not very good at communication. They're not used to going out there\nand talking about their ideas, because they don't feel that's their role. We need the professionals to change that. We need to stop thinking\nabout all these silos. There isn't one engineer silo, and then a marketing silo,\nand then an economic silo. There is just society with more need for people\ntalking with one another. That's the big thing\nI want to let you all with today: we need to get rid of these silos. The great news is that I can attest\nfor the fact that change is starting. The first time that I came back\nfrom One Young World, I went to see my department and convinced them to send me back\na second time as an official delegate - nice, big, fancy title - and I went there and I started\nseeing in Johannesburg - which is where the summit was held - that there is more people\nfrom technical backgrounds coming, and even engineering companies,\nwho were sending delegates over. The fact that my department\nwould be willing now, after I've come back from the summit,\nto send an entire delegation next year, is a sign that they've realized\nthis is the change that's happening. And they want to incorporate it. The fact that they're doing so\nand supporting me in the process is something I'm really grateful for. The reality is these engineers\nare not used or open to this idea. When you come back, and you think\nabout all these silos, it's limiting. What we need to do, us as engineers, is to be more open,\nmore approachable, more willing, more responsible for ideas,\ntake responsibilities, because it's not just the fact\nof coming up with the idea. It's also the fact of making sure\nthat it's promoted properly, that it gets out into the world, that knowledge can reach\nas many people as possible, because the greatest idea\nin an engineer's mind, you can have the smartest guy who's just in a room, having\nhis idea, and working on it, but if he's all alone in that room,\nand he's not changing anything, he's just a lonely guy in an empty room. There's no way that information\nis getting anywhere. And so far, engineers have relied\non other people to do that work for them. But we need to change\nthat dynamic a little bit. There's also the reality that society\nneeds to accept them more. If there's something you are\ngoing to do when you leave today, try and include an engineer in something\nyou have never included one in before, because they have incredible input. They're very creative people.\nThey're very open. They're just in their world.\nThey're still in their bubble. And we need to burst that bubble open. The mentality that we all work\nin these different silos is an old mentality, but it's taking\nits sweet time to die off. And we need to help it\ntake the final breath. Another piece of good news is the fact that companies\nare also starting to realize this change, because more and more people\nare graduating with degrees out there. It used to be that you could tell them\napart just based on academic ability. And that's still the belief\nin most institutions. But companies have all these positions\nopen, and they can't fill them anymore, because the graduates\nwant recognition as well. So companies are starting to look\nin profile a little bit more. All of a sudden, that little society\nI was doing on the side, extra, goes from being\na complete waste of study time to something that sets you apart\nfrom the rest of the people, and that gives you\na really valuable profile. One of the other things\nwe need to include, while we're talking\nabout education of engineers, is this idea that we need to change\nthe way we train them as well, because, when you think about it,\nwho according to a university - I'm sure you can all relate to this - who ticks all the boxes? Who's the best guy? The guy who gets 100%, right? The guy who's always there on time,\nalways giving coursework, and always gets an A. I like to call these people\nprofessors in the making, because that's what they are\ngoing to end up becoming. But universities need to update\ntheir system a little bit to make sure that we take into account\npractical implementation skills when we assess students, because having, again,\nthese greatest ideas, if you just keep them to yourself,\nthey won't be applied. These changes, I feel are necessary. The great thing is\nthat engineers are open to them. A lot of people have said of engineering\nis the most essential profession. It's the one profession\nthat sustains civilization. Why then should we keep on\naccepting it living all on its own? Let's come together\nand break down those silos. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

                    "transcript": "Understanding soil mechanics is crucial for \nany geotechnical application. Specifically,   understanding the capacity (or limits) of the soil \nis what enables successful design for foundations   or earth retaining structures. This video will be \none of a series of geotechnical videos explaining   retaining walls, shallow foundations, and stability of slopes from   an engineering point of view. However, before \nwe dive into these geotechnical applications,   first we need to understand some basic \nprinciples of soil mechanics.\nSoils,   unlike other construction materials such as steel, \ntimber, or concrete, are almost always under   compression. But interestingly, soils never fail \nin compression. All practical soil failures are   due to excessive shear stresses. Shear stresses \nare less intuitive so let s have a closer look.   The shear capacity of common engineering \nmaterials (such as steel, timber, or concrete)   is governed by the strength of their molecular \nbonds and therefore usually fairly high.  Soil, on the other hand, is a discontinuous particulate material made up of various size   particles. The interlocking of these particles is \nwhat gives the soil its resistance to shearing.   When the shear stresses along a particular \nplane or slide-surface are large enough to   make the particles roll and slide past one \nanother, failure is initiated. In the field,   shear failures of a soil mass are usually confined \nto a narrow zone where rearrangement of the   particles occurs [1]. Without these interlocking \nforces the material would behave more like a fluid   rather than a solid. This condition where the \nsoil turns into a fluid-like material does happen   sometimes and is known as liquefaction, but it is \na specialized case and we will not worry about for   now. \nBeside the interlocking or frictional shear \nstrength, some soils also posses cohesive shear   strength. Cohesion in practical terms represents \nthe stickiness of the soil such as in clay,   but is usually zero for coarse-grained soils like \nsands and gravels. \nWhat makes things complicated   is the fact that the frictional strength of the \nsoil is dependent on the pressure the soil is   under. This makes intuitive sense since if the \nsoil is compressed, the particles get further   interlocked and sliding becomes more difficult. On \nthe other hand, submerging the soil underwater has   the opposite effect since the buoyant force from \nthe water helps the particles become partially   afloat. In more technical terms, the pressure \nfrom the water acts on the particles tending to   separate them and therefore reducing the contact \nforces and friction resistance of the material.\n   In practice, the strength of soils is represented \nby the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. The German   engineer Otto Mohr graphically represented the \nstrength of the soil as a line on a graph with   the material s normal stress plotted on the x-axis \nand shear stresses on the y-axis. When the soil   is loaded it forms a semi-circle on this plot \nthat is known as the Mohr Circle. The two ends   of the circle represent the normal stresses that \nthe soil is subjected to. \nAn alternative way to   look at these is as a confining stress on the \nlow side and applied stress on the high side.   These stresses are also known as the principal \nstresses of the material. Notice, that to keep the   circle small and away from touching the failure \nenvelope, we need to increase the confining stress   together with the applied stress. In theory, if \nthe soil is well confined, its carrying capacity   can be increased indefinitely.\nNote that every \npoint in the soil mass draws a separate circle   on the graph. As the soil continues to get \nloaded, the circles grow until one or more   of them touch the failure line. The point in the \nsoil mass whose Mohr circle touches the failure   line first is where the sliding in the soil will \noccur. This usually happens simultaneously for a   whole plane in the material which initiates a \nsliding failure.\nThe slope of the failure line   is represented by a parameter called the friction \nangle which is the single most important strength   parameter for coarse-grained soils. If the \nfriction angle is high, then the soil can   resist higher shear stresses. The physical meaning \nof the friction angle is related to the incline   angle at which the soil slips during failure. \nThis is particularly important in the design of   retaining walls and shallow foundations as we will \nsee in the upcoming videos.\nFor someone unfamiliar   with yield lines this may seem overwhelming. \nThe most important takeaway from here is that   the parameter called the friction angle is \nwhat determines the strength of a soil. The   friction angle of a soil is influenced by the soil \ntype, shape of particles, groundwater condition,   and void ratio among other things. So angular, \nwell-graded, compacted soils exhibit high friction   angles and make up for the best type of soil to be \nused as backfill, or to build a foundation on.   Stay tuned for the upcoming videos where we \nwill discuss geotechnical applications such   as retaining walls and foundations.

to present a broad overview of how it helps us develop complex projects that meet the program objectives in an efficient way efficient here means that we're trying to minimize unnecessary work and rework we're trying to catch errors and defects early in the design and we're trying to effectively communicate between all of the key participants in the program so that everyone is working towards the same common goal to understand how systems engineering helps us accomplish that we're going to cover how system architectures are developed and described how we communicate the needs requirements and constraints throughout the project how we optimize the design through trade studies and how we know the system does what it's supposed to in the end so that's the overview of the series but in this video we're going to stay at a really high level and talk about what systems engineering is and why it's useful i hope you stick around for it i'm brian and welcome to a matlab tech talk systems engineering is a process that we can use to develop something that is too complex to just design and build as a single monolithic entity it's starting from an idea often nebulous and ill-defined and then putting form to it it's thinking about the system as a whole and understanding the interactions between it and the external world as well as the interactions of the internal components and it's guiding the engineering process so that the system can be described in a way that can be implemented and along the way ensuring that it's meeting the needs of the project now of course there isn't just one set of needs but competing needs from different groups of people there are the stakeholders the ones who started the whole project and drive the high level objectives these are the customers the ones who ultimately determine in the end whether the thing you built has value to them however there's also project management who needs to balance risk and schedule and the budget and other programmatic constraints and there's the engineering specialists these are the software and mechanical and electrical engineers or whoever has specific domain knowledge and is responsible for designing and implementing the system as described they need a description that is actually implementable and is clear enough to understand the key requirements and constraints but not so detailed that they have no flexibility in the implementation they are the experts after all and so they will know how to best design something so what's left outside of all of these circles is the role of systems engineering it helps guide the engineering process and to understand the needs of each of these groups and work to describe a system that is compatible with all of it at the beginning of a project we start with a nebulous set of objectives of what we're trying to accomplish we then form a few different concepts that might meet those objectives and through analysis and simulation narrow it down to a preliminary set that we want to go forward with often this set is complex enough that it needs to be broken down into smaller components and then those components can be broken down even further until you're left with a set of things that are simple enough for you to understand how to engineer them and then once these components are designed and built systems engineering is also the process of ensuring that each component does what it's supposed to do and then the integration of those components do what they're supposed to do and so on until you have a functioning top level system that satisfies the original objectives and these complex problems could take the form of a machine or it might be a software project or you might be engineering a transportation infrastructure for an entire city the key here is not the specific problem that you're trying to solve but that the problem is sufficiently complex that you can't fully grasp how to design it without first breaking it down into smaller components of course the whole process is not a linear progression where the stakeholders tell the project management what they want the systems engineers decompose that into requirements and an architecture and the engineering specialists then go off and build it the process is iterative with tight communication between all of the groups so that they can spiral in on finer details as the project progresses through definition and design which is critical because often you'll find that the needs of the different groups are in conflict with each other and only through trade studies and architecture descriptions and requirements will you figure that out and be able to work through it however this approach isn't without its own challenges new problems arise when you decompose a system into components now you need to think about what the best way is to simplify this complexity what is the best way to split up the system functionally logically and physically and then what should each of these components do so that they meet the needs of the higher level system and how can we make sure all of the components are compatible with each other so that when they're built often in different areas at different times and by different people they all come together in the end to meet the needs of the project these are the challenges of systems engineering and what makes it such an interesting field for people who enjoy solving tough cross-functional problems now to help us with this we have tools that provide simplified ways to develop system architectures and define interfaces and author requirements and trace them back to the design and we have model based approaches that let us quickly analyze and simulate the early architecture so that we can perform trade studies and find design issues sooner and we have a set of standard milestones and review cycles to ensure that we're not proceeding forward in a design that can't be implemented or won't meet a specific need now here's the thing that i want to stress at this point the architecture descriptions the reviews the trade studies and all of that stuff is additional work it's absolutely above and beyond what you have to do to develop and build a system let's say you're building a web app so ultimately the product is software writing the code has direct value to the program because it has to be there in order for the product to exist on the other hand talking about writing software is not directly valuable a product can still exist without having for example a system requirements review or a functional architecture diagram neither of those things are absolutely required because they're not part of the final delivered product in the end so if that's the case then why take a systems engineering approach at all well you can probably guess requirement reviews and architecture diagrams and everything else is necessary if the system that you're building is sufficiently complex the additional time and effort of systems engineering will be less than the time and effort required to rework and fix a system that was not architected and described correctly at the beginning this might make more sense with a simple example let's say that you are designing a car door clearly you need something structural that is hinged to the car frame and some kind of latch that can be opened from the inside and outside of the car so those are the requirements and you get a mechanical engineer on the design during integration you look at it and you think wait a second i want to be able to see out through the door as well so you have the engineer redesign the structure to hold a glass window but now you want to be able to open the window so they redesigned the door to include a mechanism for moving the window and a mechanical crank but that's not exactly what you wanted you want it to be electric well now you need to get an electrical engineer to design in a motor and a toggle switch and somehow route power from the car electrical system to the door yeah well this is close but you also don't want the window to crush fingers if it closes on them so now you need sensors and software to manage the safety element and so on and this sort of explore as we go approach can allow us to quickly jump into a project and make progress early on that we can learn from however it can also create a work and rework cycle that's expensive and time-consuming now of course this problem was contrived and a bit silly and you're probably thinking that if i was on that project at the beginning we would just brainstorm all of the things we wanted it to do then loosely figure out all of the parts and then go our separate ways to design and build our components and if we ever had a question of whether our components would interact nicely with another we just walk over and talk to each other and hash it out well that's systems engineering just on a much smaller scale everyone is a systems engineer on small projects because the problem is simple enough that the group of engineers are able to keep all of the important information in their collective memories or with ad hoc notes and everyone can work to stay in sync with the overall goals of the project and with each other but this breaks down with more complex projects where the interdependencies between the high level objectives the different functions and the components aren't as straightforward or there's just too many of them to reasonably expect an ad hoc approach will suffice so that's why we have our processes and our tools that help us decompose a system into reasonable components and architect how those components should interface with each other what they should do and how we'll test them and with model based methods we can quickly assess the system and allow us to hone in on a working design quickly and hopefully without lengthy failure and rework cycles now to illustrate this let's look at what a systems engineering approach might look like for a project where the stakeholder wants a personal air taxi service we begin with stakeholder needs analysis this is figuring out what the customer is ultimately hoping to achieve things like how many people need to be transported and over how much time and how far do they need to go and where does it need to land and take off from and what is the target cost per passenger mile and so on here we're getting a sense of what the final system should accomplish now from there we can start the process of concept exploration that is figuring out all of the different forms that the project could take should we build a fixed wing or a rotorcraft how fast should it travel how many passengers should it carry and so on models and simulations are then put together to assess the feasibility of each of these concepts so that we can trade the pros and cons of each and narrow it down to a preliminary solution and with a preliminary concept we can start putting some definition behind it with system requirements these are things like compatibility requirements like what existing airport infrastructure does it need to interface with then there's reliability maintainability and availability requirements like what are the acceptable failure rates based on the severity of the consequence and how long can the system be out of commission for maintenance and then there's also environmental requirements like what type of weather must it handle does it take off at high altitudes what about dusty environments with those high level performance requirements mostly set we can start dividing the system concept up into functions things like the airframe it has to be able to fly and stay together power needs to be stored and distributed the system has to be able to communicate with the ground infrastructure and so on then we can look at how the functions interface with each other that's the signals and the data and material and energy that is exchanged between them and we can talk about how they are physically configured is the function performed by hardware or by software and how is logic split between the different software elements we now continue to validate that the concept will meet the needs of the stakeholder through analysis and simulations we perform more trade studies where we look at the cost and performance of different specific implementations and functional organizations of the concept if it's looking promising we start developing the concept into something more concrete we derive lower level requirements and we define subsystems and start preliminary configuration and we refine the architecture descriptions and we continue to spiral through these tasks providing finer and finer detail until we get to the point where we have enough confidence to begin detailed design and manufacturing at that point we begin the process of integration and test and if we did the front end work correctly we will have minimized the number of problems and rework that needs to take place of course it doesn't guarantee that there won't be problems but the systems engineering process should keep you out of the situation of constant rework that we had with the car door example i mean could you imagine if you were in the system integration and test phase and then you realized that you should have built a fixed wing aircraft instead of a rotorcraft that would be a nightmare okay here's where i want to leave this video simple projects won't necessarily need a formal systems engineering process on the other hand something complex like building an aircraft absolutely does and in between well the specifics of how you do systems engineering can vary maybe the project could benefit from thinking about hashing out requirements but not necessarily from a formal architecture design and review each system and industry might require a slightly different approach that's why over the next few videos i'm not going to try to explain a one-size-fits-all systems engineering approach there just isn't one instead we're going to go through some of the more important tools and processes that are used in systems engineering explain how they help you simplify the problem and provide some scenarios where you may consider using them in the next video specifically we're going to look at systems engineering as an optimization problem and show how engineering experience as well as trade studies can help optimize the design through good decisions plus we'll show how models and other approximations of your system are a key part of the decision making process so if you don't want to miss that or any other tech talk video don't forget to subscribe to this channel and if you're interested you can check out my channel where i cover control theory topics as well thanks for watching and i'll see you next time"

                    "transcript": "In this instruction video I will explain you\nhow to use systems engineering for your collaborative design project. First, we define systems engineering. Then\nthe four basic steps of the systems engineering method will be discussed.\nThe relation to project management is shown. Different approaches are given. And finally,\nthe relation with BIM is defined. There are many ways in which to define systems\nengineering. Here we use the following definition:\nThe function of systems engineering is to guide the engineering of complex systems. A systems engineering method consists of four\nbasic steps, starting from the client needs and ending with a solution. You can find more\ninformation about the client in the project assignment. The solution is the project design.\nThe four basic steps are: requirements analysis, functional definition, physical definition\nand design validation. Here, the elements of the systems engineering\nmethod are displayed in a more detailed flow diagram.\nIn the following slides I will discuss each step in more detail. The first step is requirement analysis, also\nnamed: problem definition. You will collect information from the assignment document,\nbut also from the internet and university library. You can search for similar projects\nand find out which requirements they define. Obviously you have also to fulfil requirements\nthat follow from building codes and standards. You can collect information about the project\nsite itself and its surroundings. Probably there are zoning plans and maps available\nand you can collect statistical data about the urban environment. The second step is functional definition,\nalso named functional analysis and allocation. When applying systems engineering in the domain\nof architecture, engineering and construction, a function can be interpreted as a human activity\nthat is accommodated by space. For instance, at the building level the functions living\nand sleeping. At the urban level we can specify functions such as parking and shopping. When\npossible, you must specify the floor area and space volume for a human activity. Later\nin the design process, functions can also take the meaning of a system function such\nas room heating or street lighting. For these system function you need to specify\nthe required performance values, such as minimum temperature and lux. When you have developed\na complete list of function requirements according to the clients wishes and needs, you can move\non to the next step. The third step is physical definition, also\nnamed synthesis or physical analysis and allocation. The step is often considered the real design\nstep. In the step you'll use computer design software for drawing models of buildings and\nfor drawing maps of the urban environment. Use design software that is available from\nthe university software library or that you can find on the internet. With the design\nsoftware you specify the dimension of building spaces and the material properties of building\nelement. In the map drawing software you specify the road infrastructure, the green space and\nthe street furniture. The final step is design validation, also\nnamed verification and evaluation. In this step you will cheque if the functional definitions\nthat you specified in the second step are filled by the physical definitions in the\nthird step. In other words, you will cheque if your design actually fulfils the requirements\nthat you stated earlier. If you have stated that you design should accommodate the activity\nsleeping, then you must cheque if indeed a sleeping room can be found in you building\ndesign. Similarly, if you stated that your design should accommodate parking, then you\nmust cheque if your urban plan contains sufficient parking places. In the previous four steps I have briefly\nexplained the systems engineering method. However, systems engineering is part of project\nmanagement. Students that have followed courses in project management can use this knowledge\nin the collaborative design project. In literature you can find different systems\nengineering approaches. Some of them presented on this and the next slide. On the left you\nfind the famous V model, showing the design process as a decomposition and integration\nprocess at different levels. At the left of the slide, you find a cyclic\ndesign model, showing that a design evolves from conceptual design to detailed design,\nthrough many design cycles. In the collaborative design project that designed cycle typically\nwill take one week. Every week you will execute the four systems engineering steps, but obviously\nthe design will become more detailed and concrete in every design cycle. In this course you will apply systems engineering\nand building information modelling. The system engineering four step method is used to organise\nthe design process. Building information modelling tools are used to create the design. With\nthe BIM tools you implement a collaborative design monitoring system, that allows you\nto track and trace every design change during the design project. So, to conclude, the function of systems engineering\nis to guide the engineering of complex systems. And having this structured process helps you\ndealing with the requirements in a complex project. Finally, if you are interested in systems\nengineering, you can download a copy of the systems engineering book from the university\nlibrary. The book is useful during the design project\nto find practical tips, but also when writing you academic paper at the end of the course."

                    "transcript": "In this video,   we talk about the system design interview \nframework that we used in our books. We explain why you might want to consider \nusing something similar when you interview. Let’s first talk about why we \nmight want to follow a framework. Interviews are stressful. There is very little time to \nshow off what we are capable of. Without any structure, it is easy to waste \nprecious time on things that don’t matter. An unstructured interview makes it \ndifficult for the interviewer to follow. Our framework provides a time-tested structure. It is simple and powerful. It leads us to ask the \nright questions and focus on the right things. Here are the 4 steps in our framework. Step 1 - Understand the problem \nand establish design scope. Step 2 - Propose high-level design and get buy-in Step 3 - Design deep dive Step 4 - Wrap up This framework works well for a typical 45-60 \nminute long system design interview session. Usually, the first 5 mins is an \nintroduction, and the last 5 is Q&A. The meat of the interview \nis only about 35-45 mins. We suggest allocating about 5 minutes to step 1,   20 mins to step 2, 15 mins to \nstep 3, and 5 mins to step 4. Keep in mind this is just a rough \nguideline. Feel free to adjust as needed. Let’s take a closer look \nat each of the four steps. Step 1 - Understand the problem \nand establish design scope. System design questions are usually open-ended. Sometimes they are presented in \na way that is deliberately vague. This tests our ability to organize our \nthoughts and focus on what is important. It is our job to ask as many questions as \nnecessary to understand the problem fully. It is a red flag to jump right into a solution \nwithout first understanding what we are building. What questions should we ask? Our goal is to clarify the requirements. We want to understand why \nwe are building the system,   who the users are, and what \nfeatures we need to build. For example, if we are asked to design a chat app,   it is important to recognize that there are many \ndifferent types of chat apps in the marketplace. There are one-on-one and small-group \nchat apps like WhatsApp, office chat   apps like Slack, or group chat apps like Discord. They have different design \nchallenges and constraints. The goal is to understand the features \nwe are building in priority order. We should focus on the top few features to build. Make sure the interviewer \nagrees to the feature list. It is also important to ask a series of questions \nto clarify the non-functional requirements. For system design interviews, we suggest \nfocusing on scale and performance. These non-functional requirements are what \nmake our design unique and challenging. For example, designing a Twitter clone \nto support a few hundred users is easy,   while designing it for hundreds of \nmillions of users with some popular   accounts having millions of followers \nis interesting and challenging. The more senior the role is, the more important it   is for us to demonstrate our ability to \nhandle the non-functional requirements. To help us get a sense of the scale of \nthe system and the potential challenges   and bottlenecks, we might do some rough \nback-of-the-envelope calculations here. Keep in mind that we have yet to design anything, \nso the math we do here is a rough estimate. The goal is to get a general sense of the scale. We want to get the order of magnitude right. This step should take about 5 minutes. At the end, we should have \na short list of features to   design for, along with a few important \nnon-functional requirements to satisfy. For step 2 of our framework, we aim to \ndevelop a high-level design and reach   an agreement with the interviewer on the design. For most designs, we would suggest a \ntop-down approach and start with the APIs. The APIs establish a contract between \nthe end users and the backend systems. It should be clear after gathering the \nrequirements what APIs we would need. Unless it is specified otherwise, we \nshould follow the RESTful convention. Define each API’s input parameters \nand output responses carefully. Take the time to carefully review the APIs. Verify that they satisfy \nthe functional requirements. Equally important to remember. Do not introduce APIs that have nothing \nto do with the functional requirements. An additional consideration on API. Some designs might call for two-way \ncommunication between client and server. In this scenario, Websocket \nis a common solution here. Be mindful that a socket service \nlike websocket is stateful. It is quite challenging to operate at scale. If the scale is high, be prepared \nto discuss how we would manage a   WebSocket deployment in the deep dive section. Once we have established the APIs \nbetween the client and the server,   the next step is to lay out \nthe high-level design diagram. The diagram is the blueprint of the \noverall design that we can refer back to. We should use it to verify that the design \nsatisfies all the feature requirements end-to-end. For many designs, it starts with \na load balancer or an API gateway. Behind that are the services \nthat would satisfy the feature   requirements we established \nearlier with the interviewer. Many services require some form of persistence. This is where we would round out the design \nby introducing the data storage layer. It is usually not necessary to specify the \nexact database technology to use at this stage. This should be deferred to the \ndeep dive section if necessary,   and only after we have designed the data schema. For example, for a map service like Google Maps,   the client often needs to send \nfrequent GPS updates to the server. We would include in our design \na location data store that a   location update service would write to. Repeat the steps above and complete the high-level \ndesign diagram for all the major features. Here is a pro tip. While developing the high-level design, \nmaintain a list of discussion points for later. Resist the temptation to dig \ninto too much detail too early. Do not dig ourselves into a hole before \nwe have a full picture of the design. The last step of the high-level design \nis to hash out the data model and schema. Here we should discuss the data access \npatterns and the read/write ratio. At scale, data modeling could significantly \nimpact the performance of the design. If it is simple, also discuss the databases to \nchoose, and maybe discuss the indexing options. Here we should make some judgment calls. If the data modeling is the key part of \nthe design to satisfy the non-functional   requirements, we might want to defer \nthe discussion to the deep dive section. When we are done with the high-level design, \ntake a step back and review the design. Make sure each feature is complete end-to-end. Here we reach the third step of \nthe framework - design deep dive. The goal of this section is to demonstrate \nthat we could identify areas that could   potentially be problematic and come up \nwith solutions and discuss trade-offs. We should work with the interviewer \nclosely to decide what to discuss in depth. Deep dive is where non-functional \nrequirements make the problem interesting. The higher the level, the more \nimportant this section is. The section is really open-ended. There is no one-size-fits-all approach. Here is where the ability to \n“read-the-room” is useful. Sometimes the interviewer’s body \nlanguage would give away clues   that they are dissatisfied with \ncertain aspects of the design. It is important to pick up these clues \nand make sure the issues are addressed. One way we could approach \nit is by asking questions. We could list out the reasons for \nchoosing a particular solution   and ask if they have any questions or concerns. Once we pick out a problem \nor two to dive deeper into,   we should come up with multiple solutions \nand discuss the trade-offs for each option. We could use the following mini \nguidelines when framing the discussion. First, we should clearly articulate the problem. For example, for designing Google \nMaps, the write QPS at 1 M/sec to   the location database is too high \nfor a single database to handle. Next, we come up with at least two solutions. Continuing with the example above, we \ncould propose to reduce the location   update frequency per user, or choose a NoSQL \ndatabase that could handle the write rate. Third, we discuss the trade-offs of the solutions. Remember to use numbers to back up our design. Finally, we pick a solution and \ndiscuss it with the interviewer. Repeat this for other problems. \nIn a typical interview,   we should only have time to dive \ndeeper into the top 2 or 3 issues. Lastly, we have reached the last step - wrap-up. We suggest spending a few \nminutes summarizing the design. Here we should focus on the parts that \nare unique to the particular situation. Keep this short and sweet. Leave enough time at the end of the interview to \nask the interviewer questions about the company. That’s it on the system \ndesign interview framework. We hope you find it useful.
