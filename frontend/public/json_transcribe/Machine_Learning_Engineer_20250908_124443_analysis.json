                    "transcript": "everybody's talking about artificial intelligence these days AI machine learning is another Hot Topic are they the same thing or are they different and if so what are those differences and deep learning is another one that comes into play I actually did a video on these three artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning and talked about where they fit and there were a lot of comments on that and I read those comments and I'd like to address some of the most frequently asked questions so that we clear up some of the myths and misconceptions around this in addition something else has happened since that video was recorded and that is this the absolute explosion of this area of generative AI things like large language models and chat Bots have seemed to be taking over the world we see them everywhere really interesting technology uh and then also things like deep fakes these are all within the realm of AI but how do they fit within each other how are they related to each other we're going to take a look at that in this video and try to explain how all these Technologies relate and how we can use them first off a little bit of a disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify some of these Concepts in order to not make this video last for a week so those of you that are really deep experts in the field apologies in advance but we're going to try to make this simple and and that will involve some generalizations first of all let's start with AI artificial intelligence is basically trying to simulate with a computer something that would match or exceed human intelligence what is intelligence well it could be a lot of different things but generally we tend to think of it as the ability to learn to infer and to reason things like that so that's what we're trying to do in the broad field of AI of artificial intelligence and if we look at a timeline of AI it really kind of started back around on this time frame and in those days it was very premature most people had not even heard of it uh and uh it basically was a research project but I can tell you uh as an undergrad which for me was back during these times uh we were doing AI work in fact we would use programming languages like lisp uh or prologue uh and these kinds of things uh were kind of the predecessors to what became later expert systems and this was a technology again some of these things existed previous but that's when it really uh hit kind of a critical mass and became more popularized so expert systems of the 1980s maybe in the 90s and and again we use Technologies like this all of this uh was was something that we did before we ever touched in to the next topic I'm going to talk about and that's the area of machine learning machine learning is as its name implies the machine is learning I don't have to program it I give it lots of information and and it observes things so for instance if I start doing this if I give you this and then ask you to predict what's the next thing that's going to be there well you might get it you might not you have very limited training data to base this on but if I gave you one of those and then ask you what to predict would happen next well you're probably going to say this and then you're going to say it's this and then you think you got it all figured out and then you see one of these and then all of a sudden I give you one of those and throw you a curveball so this in fact and then maybe it it goes on like this so a machine learning algorithm is really good at looking at patterns and discovering patterns within data the more training data you can give it the more confident it can be in predicting so predictions are one of the things that machine learning is is particularly good at another thing is spotting outliers like this and saying oh that doesn't belong in it looks different than all the other stuff because the sequence was broken so that's particularly useful in cyber security the area that I work in because we're looking for outliers we're looking for users who are using the system in ways that they shouldn't be or ways that they don't typically do so this technology machine learning is particularly useful for us and machine learning really came along uh and became more popularized uh in this time frame uh in the the 2010s uh and again uh back when I was an undergrad riding my dinosaur to class we were doing this kind of stuff we never once talked about machine learning it might have existed but it really wasn't hadn't hit the popular uh mindset yet uh but this technology has matured greatly over the last few decades and now it becomes the basis of a lot we do going forward the next layer of our Vin diagram involves deep learning well it's deep learning in the sense that with deep learning we use these things called neural networks neural networks are ways that in a computer we simulate and mimic the way the human brain works at least to the extent that we understand how the brain works and it's called Deep because we have multiple layers of those neural networks and the interesting thing about these is they will simulate the way a brain operates but I don't know if you've noticed but human brains can be a little bit unpredictable you put certain things in you don't always get the very same thing out and deep learning is the same way in some cases we're not actually able to fully understand why we get the results we do uh because there are so many layers to the neural network it's a little bit hard to to decompose and figure out exactly what's in there but this has become a very important part and a very important advancement that also reached some popularity during the 2010s and as something that we use still today as the basis for our next area of AI the most recent advancements in the field of artificial in intelligence all really are in this space the area of generative AI now I'm going to introduce a term that you may not be familiar with it's the idea of foundation models Foundation models is where we get some of these kinds of things for instance an example of a foundation model would be a large language model which is where we take language and we model it and we make predictions in this technology where if I see certain types of of words then I can sort of predict what the next set of words will be I'm going to oversimplify here for the sake of Simplicity but think about this as a little bit like the autoc complete when you start typing something in and then it predicts what your next word will be except in this case with large language models they're not predicting the next word they're predicting the next sentence the next paragraph the next entire document so there's a really an amazing exponential leap in what these things are able to do and we call all of these Technologies generative because they are generating new content um some people have actually made the argument that the generative AI isn't really generative that that these Technologies are really just regurgitating existing information and putting it in different format well let me give you an analogy um if you take music for instance then every note has already been invented so in a sense every song is just a recombination some other permutation of all the notes that already exist already and just putting them in a different order well we don't say new new music doesn't exist people are still composing and creating new songs from the existing information I'm going to say geni is similar it's a it's an analogy so there'll be some imperfections in it but you get the general idea actually new content can be generated out of these and there are a lot of different forms that this can take with other types of models are uh Audio models uh video models and things like that well in fact these we can use to create deep fakes and deep fakes are examples where we're able to take for instance a person's voice and recreate that and then have it seem like the person said things they never said well it's really useful in entertainment situations uh in parities and things like that uh or if someone's losing their voice then you could capture their voice and then they'd be able to type and you'd be able to hear it in their voice but there's also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused um the chat Bots again come from this space the Deep fakes come from this space but they're all part of generative Ai and all part of these Foundation models and this again is the area that has really caused all of us to really pay attention to AI the possibilities of generating new content or in some cases summarizing existing content and giving us uh something that is bite-size and manageable this is what has gotten all of the attention this is where the chat Bots and all of these things come in in the early days ai's adoption started off pretty slowly most people didn't even know it existed and if they did it was something that always seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years away but then machine learning deep learning and things like that came along and we started seeing some uptake then Foundation models gen Ai and the light came along and this stuff went straight to the Moon these Foundation models are what have changed the adoption curve and now you see AI being adopted everywhere and the thing for us to understand is where this is where it fits in and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of this technology if you like this video and want to see more like

                    "transcript": "Deep learning has enabled us to build detailed specialized AI models,   and we can do that provided we gather enough data, label it, and use that to train and deploy those models. Models like customer service chatbots or fraud detection in banking. Now, in the past if you wanted to build a new model for your specialization - so, say a model for predictive maintenance in manufacturing - well, you’d need to start again with data selection and curation, labeling, model development, training, and validation. But foundation models are changing that paradigm. So what is a foundation model? A foundation model is a more focused, centralized effort to create a base model. And, through fine tuning, that base foundation model can be adapted to a specialized model. Need an AI model for programming language translation? Well, start with a foundational model and then fine tune it with programming language data. Fine tuning and adapting base foundation models rapidly speeds up AI model development. So, how do we do that? Let’s look at the five stages of the workflow to create an AI model. Stage 1 is to prepare the data. Now in this stage we need to train our AI model with the data we're going to use, and we're going to need a lot of data. Potentially petabytes of data across dozens of domains. The data can combine both available open source data and proprietary data. Now this stage performs a series of data processing tasks. Those include categorization which describes what the data is. So which data is English, which is German? Which is Ansible which is Java? That sort of thing. Then the data is also applied with a filtere. So filtering allows us to, for example, apply filters for hate speech, and profanity and abuse, and that sort of thing. Stuff we want to filter out of the system that we don't train the model on it. Other filters may flag copyrighted material, private or sensitive information. Something else we're going to take out is  duplicate data as well. So we're going to remove that from there. And then that leaves us with something called a base data pile. So that's really the output of stage one. And this base data pile can be versioned and tagged. And that allows us to say, \"This is what I’m training the AI model on, and here are the filters I used\". It's perfect for governance. Now, Stage 2 is to train the model. And we're going to train the model on those base data piles. So we start this stage by picking the foundational model we want to use. So we will select our model. Now, there are many types of foundation models. There are generative foundation models, encoder-only models, lightweight models, high parameter models. Are you looking to build an AI model to use as a chatbot, or as a classifier? So pick the foundational model that matches your use case, then match the data pile with that model. Next we take the data pile and we tokenize it. Foundation models work with tokens rather than words, and a data pile could result in potentially trillions of tokens.   And now we can engage the process of training using all of those tokens. This process can take a long time, depending on the size of the model. Large scale foundation models can take months with many thousands of GPUs. But, once it’s done, the longest and highest computational costs are behind us. Stage 3 is \"validate\". When training is finished we benchmark the model. And this involves running the model and assessing its performance against a set of benchmarks that help define the quality of the model. And then from here we can create a model card that says this is the model I’ve trained and these are the benchmark scores it has achieved. Now up until this point the main persona that has performed these tasks is the data scientist. Now Stage 4 is \"tune\", and this is where we bring in the persona of the application developer. This persona does not need to be an AI expert. They engage with the model, generating - for example - prompts that elicit good performance from the model. They can provide additional local data to fine tune the model to improve its performance. And this stage is something that you can do in hours or days - much quicker than building a model from scratch. And now we’re ready for Stage 5, which is to deployment the model. Now this model could run as as service offering deployed to a public cloud. Or we could, alternatively, embed the model into an application that runs much closer to the edge of the network. Either way we can continue to iterate and improve the model over time. Now here at IBM we’ve announced a platform that enables all 5 of the stages of this workflow. And It’s called watsonx and it’s composed of three elements. So we have: watsonx.data, watsonx.governance, and watsonx.ai., and this all built on IBM’s hybrid cloud platform which is Red Hat OpenShift. Now Watsonx.data is a modern data lakehouse and establishes connections with the data repositories that make up the data in Stage 1. Watsonx.governance manages the data cards from Stage 1 and model cards from Stage 3 enabling a collection of fact sheets that ensure a well-governed AI process and lifecycle. And watsonx.ai provides a means for the application developer persona to engage with the model in Stage 4. Overall foundation models are changing the way we build specialized AI models   and this 5-stage workflow allows teams to create AI and AI-derived applications with greater sophistication while rapidly speeding up AI model development."

                    "transcript": "AI is changing extremely fast in 2025 and so is the way that you should be learning it. So, in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how I would learn AI and ML if I was starting completely from scratch with all of the knowledge that I have today. Let's get into it. Now, the first thing or step zero on my list would be to make sure that I was thinking like an engineer. Now look, there's a long list of topics that I'm going to share with you here. All things that are important to learn. But none of them matter if you don't build that deep critical thinking skill. The things that separate good software engineers from great software engineers are the ability to break down problems and to think critically. So as you listen to this list, keep in mind that it's not about memorizing concepts. It's about truly understanding what's going on and being able to solve abstract complex problems, which is really where humans come in and where we're not yet being replaced by AI models. Anyways with step zero out of the way, the first thing that I would be focusing on is really diving deep into Python. Now look, obviously there's all kinds of no code tools out there, but if you want to be an effective AI or ML engineer, I do believe that you still do need to know how to code. And the best way to do that is to start with Python. Python is just the easiest language to learn. It's the best for AI and ML. And personally, if I was diving into this, I would be focusing on learning the fundamentals skipping all of the advanced theory, and building automation projects as quickly as possible. That's what Python is really good at, automating tasks, doing things like data science. So, I would start with things like scripting or scraping. So, web scraping for example. Then I would get into things like numpy mapplot, lib, and pandas. and just get really competent working with data sets within Python. I would also focus on learning the basics of APIs. So, how to make a very simple one and how to call APIs from Python. I'd be doing all of this with the goal of building projects as quickly as possible, not getting into the weeds of all of the theoretical concepts and really just getting comfortable writing code in Python so I can use this as a tool later on when I dive more into the advanced AI and ML stuff. So, that's step one. get comfortable with Python and do it in a practical way using a lot of the tools that I just mentioned. That's personally what I would be doing. And by the way guys, what I'm sharing with you here is not necessarily what I would do if I was trying to land a job, but it's purely what I would do to get good at this as quickly as possible. Now, with that in mind, if you are trying to land an AI or ML job, something that you're going to struggle with is finding a program that teaches you practical skills, but actually balances that with real world credibility. Now, that's why I was quite impressed when I came across SimplyLearn, the sponsor of today's video. Now, this is a world's leading online platform for tech and business education, and they've got a full catalog of hands-on boot camps, and their AI and machine learning programs are seriously well put together. These are live instructor-led classes, not just videos, and they're built in collaboration with some of the world's top universities and companies. The curriculum is projectbased careerfocused, and covers tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Chat GPT depending on the path that you choose. Now, they've got thousands of five-star reviews, recommendations from Switch up Course Support, and Forbes, and tons of success stories from students that have completely changed their career after going through the program. Now, if you're serious about getting into AI or ML, then definitely check out Simply Learns Programs. Click the link in the description or the pinned comment to take your first step towards your next big career move. Now, moving on to step number two, and this one I would try to do fairly quickly, and that's to become data literate. What I mean by this is just being familiar working with data. So, I'd want to learn some basic SQL like some joins, some select statements. What actually is SQL? How do you work with this? I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

                    "transcript": "everybody's talking about artificial intelligence these days AI machine learning is another Hot Topic are they the same thing or are they different and if so what are those differences and deep learning is another one that comes into play I actually did a video on these three artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning and talked about where they fit and there were a lot of comments on that and I read those comments and I'd like to address some of the most frequently asked questions so that we clear up some of the myths and misconceptions around this in addition something else has happened since that video was recorded and that is this the absolute explosion of this area of generative AI things like large language models and chat Bots have seemed to be taking over the world we see them everywhere really interesting technology uh and then also things like deep fakes these are all within the realm of AI but how do they fit within each other how are they related to each other we're going to take a look at that in this video and try to explain how all these Technologies relate and how we can use them first off a little bit of a disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify some of these Concepts in order to not make this video last for a week so those of you that are really deep experts in the field apologies in advance but we're going to try to make this simple and and that will involve some generalizations first of all let's start with AI artificial intelligence is basically trying to simulate with a computer something that would match or exceed human intelligence what is intelligence well it could be a lot of different things but generally we tend to think of it as the ability to learn to infer and to reason things like that so that's what we're trying to do in the broad field of AI of artificial intelligence and if we look at a timeline of AI it really kind of started back around on this time frame and in those days it was very premature most people had not even heard of it uh and uh it basically was a research project but I can tell you uh as an undergrad which for me was back during these times uh we were doing AI work in fact we would use programming languages like lisp uh or prologue uh and these kinds of things uh were kind of the predecessors to what became later expert systems and this was a technology again some of these things existed previous but that's when it really uh hit kind of a critical mass and became more popularized so expert systems of the 1980s maybe in the 90s and and again we use Technologies like this all of this uh was was something that we did before we ever touched in to the next topic I'm going to talk about and that's the area of machine learning machine learning is as its name implies the machine is learning I don't have to program it I give it lots of information and and it observes things so for instance if I start doing this if I give you this and then ask you to predict what's the next thing that's going to be there well you might get it you might not you have very limited training data to base this on but if I gave you one of those and then ask you what to predict would happen next well you're probably going to say this and then you're going to say it's this and then you think you got it all figured out and then you see one of these and then all of a sudden I give you one of those and throw you a curveball so this in fact and then maybe it it goes on like this so a machine learning algorithm is really good at looking at patterns and discovering patterns within data the more training data you can give it the more confident it can be in predicting so predictions are one of the things that machine learning is is particularly good at another thing is spotting outliers like this and saying oh that doesn't belong in it looks different than all the other stuff because the sequence was broken so that's particularly useful in cyber security the area that I work in because we're looking for outliers we're looking for users who are using the system in ways that they shouldn't be or ways that they don't typically do so this technology machine learning is particularly useful for us and machine learning really came along uh and became more popularized uh in this time frame uh in the the 2010s uh and again uh back when I was an undergrad riding my dinosaur to class we were doing this kind of stuff we never once talked about machine learning it might have existed but it really wasn't hadn't hit the popular uh mindset yet uh but this technology has matured greatly over the last few decades and now it becomes the basis of a lot we do going forward the next layer of our Vin diagram involves deep learning well it's deep learning in the sense that with deep learning we use these things called neural networks neural networks are ways that in a computer we simulate and mimic the way the human brain works at least to the extent that we understand how the brain works and it's called Deep because we have multiple layers of those neural networks and the interesting thing about these is they will simulate the way a brain operates but I don't know if you've noticed but human brains can be a little bit unpredictable you put certain things in you don't always get the very same thing out and deep learning is the same way in some cases we're not actually able to fully understand why we get the results we do uh because there are so many layers to the neural network it's a little bit hard to to decompose and figure out exactly what's in there but this has become a very important part and a very important advancement that also reached some popularity during the 2010s and as something that we use still today as the basis for our next area of AI the most recent advancements in the field of artificial in intelligence all really are in this space the area of generative AI now I'm going to introduce a term that you may not be familiar with it's the idea of foundation models Foundation models is where we get some of these kinds of things for instance an example of a foundation model would be a large language model which is where we take language and we model it and we make predictions in this technology where if I see certain types of of words then I can sort of predict what the next set of words will be I'm going to oversimplify here for the sake of Simplicity but think about this as a little bit like the autoc complete when you start typing something in and then it predicts what your next word will be except in this case with large language models they're not predicting the next word they're predicting the next sentence the next paragraph the next entire document so there's a really an amazing exponential leap in what these things are able to do and we call all of these Technologies generative because they are generating new content um some people have actually made the argument that the generative AI isn't really generative that that these Technologies are really just regurgitating existing information and putting it in different format well let me give you an analogy um if you take music for instance then every note has already been invented so in a sense every song is just a recombination some other permutation of all the notes that already exist already and just putting them in a different order well we don't say new new music doesn't exist people are still composing and creating new songs from the existing information I'm going to say geni is similar it's a it's an analogy so there'll be some imperfections in it but you get the general idea actually new content can be generated out of these and there are a lot of different forms that this can take with other types of models are uh Audio models uh video models and things like that well in fact these we can use to create deep fakes and deep fakes are examples where we're able to take for instance a person's voice and recreate that and then have it seem like the person said things they never said well it's really useful in entertainment situations uh in parities and things like that uh or if someone's losing their voice then you could capture their voice and then they'd be able to type and you'd be able to hear it in their voice but there's also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused um the chat Bots again come from this space the Deep fakes come from this space but they're all part of generative Ai and all part of these Foundation models and this again is the area that has really caused all of us to really pay attention to AI the possibilities of generating new content or in some cases summarizing existing content and giving us uh something that is bite-size and manageable this is what has gotten all of the attention this is where the chat Bots and all of these things come in in the early days ai's adoption started off pretty slowly most people didn't even know it existed and if they did it was something that always seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years away but then machine learning deep learning and things like that came along and we started seeing some uptake then Foundation models gen Ai and the light came along and this stuff went straight to the Moon these Foundation models are what have changed the adoption curve and now you see AI being adopted everywhere and the thing for us to understand is where this is where it fits in and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of this technology if you like this video and want to see more like

                    "transcript": "PyTorch has emerged as the de facto standard for \nmachine learning and deep learning. And I know a little bit about PyTorch, but I've brought in an \nexpert, Sahdev Zala, to teach us all more about PyTorch. So, Sahdev, what is PyTorch? Hi Brad! So it's a framework for machine learning and deep learning. And what I mean by that is you can use PyTorch to build your models because it provides you all of the building blocks. It provides you all the functionalities\nto run faster training on that model. And it's an open source project under PyTorch Foundation, \nwhich is part of the Linux Foundation. So there is a dynamic community behind the project. Oh, great! So it's got an ecosystem and it's in the Foundation. So that means you're going to have open governance\nand a level playing field. That's wonderful. Well, Sahdev, can you tell \nme about the key features of PyTorch? Yeah, sure. That's a great question. So let me just mention \nthe common steps of model training. So first, you need to prep your data, your data set for training. And, ideally you also want to do it for testing. And then, the other steps is you're \ngoing to build your model. And you're going to train it. And as I mentioned, you're going to test. Okay. So those look like some\npretty straightforward features. Why don't you tell me about the first one? \nWhat do you mean by prepping the data? Right. So, the data says are you going to use \nfor your model, maybe small as you're learning it, but for larger models, these data sets can \nbe huge--10 terabytes, petabytes wide. So how do you use this data\nto train your model and then test it? So PyTorch provides you two things here. Data sets and data loader classes that help \nyou to easily feed this data for your training and testing. Okay. How does this help me?\nDoes it speed things up? Well, that's a good question. So, it helps you to download \nthe data to make it accessible for your training and testing. And this data loader, it provides you iterator over this \ndata so that you can use them to train in a batch. Because you're not going to just feed one data \nat a time. You're going to train using the batch sizes that you want. It also provides you other things like shuffling the data. You don't want to just feed the data in an order so that your model, \nit's only memorizing the data versus versus it's learning. So this will shuffle for you as well. \nIt has other features as well. Very nice. Well, it also helps you to build models?  Absolutely. So, once you think you're ready with your preparation using PyTorch because it takes you all the takes \ncare of all the complexity, the next step would   be and building the model to define your models \nand for that what you need is layers because it's   a deep learning, it's made of multiple layers. \nSo you need different layers like linear layer or   combination layer. And there are many others that \nare provided by partners to you. And that are also   things like, besides layers, that are activation \nfunctions that you'll be using to add nonlinearity   to your model-- that's also provided to you by \nPyTorch. So you don't have to do anything but   just to call those functions.   What do you mean by nonlinearity? So, in general, when you train the model and then-- it's a \nmathematical term, right, linear as well,   but it will if you don't get nonlinear, you \nbasically just get like a one straight line.   And in real life, not everything is just \nchanging in X will be same as changing your Y   output. So it adds you that nonlinearity for \nyou. And the next step would be training and there   basically I can talk more about the training side, Brad.  Well, so tell me about features-- \nwhat  does it do to help you train?  So training will require to use the loss function. And loss function   is basically to find out the loss that you going \nto have. As when you run this model like   a forward pass from the input and you get some \noutput. Well, I'm not going to have the correct output   every time magically, there's no magic there. So \nyou can have lots of parameters in between, you are just going to randomize them in the beginning, \nyou got some output, but then you're going to   have a loss function to calculate the loss from \nthe desired output. So your want your model to reach a certain expectation. \nAnd typically during the training process that model's falling short   and you're seeing how much it's falling short \nfrom where you want it to be. Exactly. So that loss functions, there are multiple loss\nfunctions and PyTorch provides it to you again. You again   you call them according to your need for \nthe model. Once you have the loss function used,   the next big thing is finding the gradient of this \nloss with regards to your parameters. So PyTorch   provides the backward propagation for you, or, \nauto-grade features. That is by far one of the   most popular feature of PyTorch, that it will \ncalculate the gradient for you.  So if we all think back from our calculus days, gradients are \nthis piece that helps you to tweak and   get the model the way you want it and it's got \nit built-in for you.  Exactly. So once you got the gradient, you basically\nrun the optimizer function just to step over, which is again   provided by PyTorch to you. And like you exactly \nsaid, you're going to tweak the parameters, you're   going to optimize it to reach to a level in a \nnumber of iterations. So that you basically define   those iterations. But the number of iterations \nyou're going to reach to a level where we're like,   you know what, that should be enough training. \nI do like 3x, 5x iterations, and at that point   you are ready to test it.  And is that a big deal for these models to have to do testing or I just  test once I'm done? Or is it more more than that?  Yeah. So the next step would be no. From here to the test side. You need to test it. Ideally it's optional. But as part of testing, PyTorch provides   a function, an eval evaluation. So you can \nevaluate your model. And at that point, you're not   going to calculate the gradient, you're not going \nto find the loss function. You basically just do   the forward pass. You see what you're getting. And \nif you're happy with it, then pretty much ready   to use the model. If you're not, then you're \ngoing to do the further training. And again,   this data sets, which I mentioned earlier, that \nwould be used for training useful test, white or   black are two different datasets. So as part of the testing. I'm getting to decide, hey, \nis my model good enough? I think I'm ready to go with it. Pretty much, yeah.  Well, it all seems a little complicated to me.\nIs PyTorch really easy to use?  Well, yes,  that's one of the best things I love about PyTorch. \nIt's easy to get started. It's easy to install.   It's easy to use because it's Pythonic; the \"Py\" \nin PyTorch is for Python. So you know how much   data scientists just love Python. Absolutely. \nPyTorch is in Python. And it's been easily I use   by data scientists. And if someone if they don't \nknow Python, they can learn it quickly as well.   PyTorch.org provides a lot of good documentation, \ntutorials that will help you to get started very   quickly and it's also flexible. So I mentioned \nthe training on your right. You can run training,   you can run your PyTorch on CPU just \nusing the tensor that PyTorch uses in   data structure (multi-dimensional \narrays). They can be run on CPUs,   they can be run on GPUs, they can do the training \non multiple CPU and GPU on a single machine,   you can do that on a distributed environment on \nmultiple machines, multiple GPUs. And you can   like say part of that you can just run PyTorch on \nyour laptop and play with it. There is also like   a mobile development going on to to help PyTorch \non your mobile devices.  So yeah, it's a lot of  options. Supports a lot of platforms. GPUs. \nCPUs. Well, what if I want to be a contributor?   Well, that's great question. Something I love as \nan contributor myself, so it's actually very easy.   PyTorch is part of PyTorch Foundation as I \nmentioned. There's a dynamic community behind it,   very friendly. Lots of people are going to help \nyou to get started, to contribute. As long as you   sign the CLA, follow the code of conduct, these \nare things to do. You are ready to contribute.   The community also provides weekly office hours. \n  Office hours, that's huge. I can come in as\na new person and say, hey, could you help me out or can you give me an easy first item to work on?\nI could do that in an office hours.  Yes, exactly. And there are things like you can easily\nfind the good first issues. You can find the document issues to \n  get started with and you can ask questions. \nAnd the office hours, through their Slack channel is another one.  And one of the classic tips is when you join a new project, \nask for a mentor and ask them to put you to work on something. Because   when they put you to work on something, they're \ngoing to be very interested in what you're doing   and they're going to give you timely reviews and \nanswer all your questions. So tell me more about   how IBM is contributing to PyTorch. Yeah, sure. \nWell, IBM is contributing to PyTorch in a big way, like IBM always do. By using PyTorch, so we are \ngoing to contribute to help the community, grow   the community. And a part of that, we working on \nmany different things, something called like FSDP,   Fully Sharded Data Parallel, well, an advanced topic, \nbut it helps you to shard the model parameters   across multiple GPUs across multiple machines\nfor fast training and for your   large models they may not fit in like a single GPU \nor CPU. And so we are contributing there. There's   really good blog posts out there. Just search \nfor it, \"IBM FSDP PyTorch\" wiil find it quickly.   Highly recommend to read it. We also provide \nimprovements in the storage site for training,   compiler optimizations. And besides that benchmarking,\n test side improvements and documentation.   And we have multiple developers working in the \ncommunity.  So it sounds like there's lots of nice features to help it\nsupport those large foundation models, supporting multiple GPUs   and running in a distributed fashion. And \na lot of work being done for benchmarking,   seeing how fast things are running and obviously \na lot of work in the documentation to help others   get started. It's a fabulous. It is. It's amazing. I'm so glad to be part of the community.  Well, thank you, Sahdev. I've learned a lot today. This \nis fabulous. We hope that you've learned a lot   about PyTorch and we encourage you to come \njoin the community. We really enjoy working   on PyTorch and pushing forward with your deep \nlearning/machine learning initiatives.   Thanks for watching our video.

                    "transcript": "AI is changing extremely fast in 2025 and so is the way that you should be learning it. So, in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how I would learn AI and ML if I was starting completely from scratch with all of the knowledge that I have today. Let's get into it. Now, the first thing or step zero on my list would be to make sure that I was thinking like an engineer. Now look, there's a long list of topics that I'm going to share with you here. All things that are important to learn. But none of them matter if you don't build that deep critical thinking skill. The things that separate good software engineers from great software engineers are the ability to break down problems and to think critically. So as you listen to this list, keep in mind that it's not about memorizing concepts. It's about truly understanding what's going on and being able to solve abstract complex problems, which is really where humans come in and where we're not yet being replaced by AI models. Anyways with step zero out of the way, the first thing that I would be focusing on is really diving deep into Python. Now look, obviously there's all kinds of no code tools out there, but if you want to be an effective AI or ML engineer, I do believe that you still do need to know how to code. And the best way to do that is to start with Python. Python is just the easiest language to learn. It's the best for AI and ML. And personally, if I was diving into this, I would be focusing on learning the fundamentals skipping all of the advanced theory, and building automation projects as quickly as possible. That's what Python is really good at, automating tasks, doing things like data science. So, I would start with things like scripting or scraping. So, web scraping for example. Then I would get into things like numpy mapplot, lib, and pandas. and just get really competent working with data sets within Python. I would also focus on learning the basics of APIs. So, how to make a very simple one and how to call APIs from Python. I'd be doing all of this with the goal of building projects as quickly as possible, not getting into the weeds of all of the theoretical concepts and really just getting comfortable writing code in Python so I can use this as a tool later on when I dive more into the advanced AI and ML stuff. So, that's step one. get comfortable with Python and do it in a practical way using a lot of the tools that I just mentioned. That's personally what I would be doing. And by the way guys, what I'm sharing with you here is not necessarily what I would do if I was trying to land a job, but it's purely what I would do to get good at this as quickly as possible. Now, with that in mind, if you are trying to land an AI or ML job, something that you're going to struggle with is finding a program that teaches you practical skills, but actually balances that with real world credibility. Now, that's why I was quite impressed when I came across SimplyLearn, the sponsor of today's video. Now, this is a world's leading online platform for tech and business education, and they've got a full catalog of hands-on boot camps, and their AI and machine learning programs are seriously well put together. These are live instructor-led classes, not just videos, and they're built in collaboration with some of the world's top universities and companies. The curriculum is projectbased careerfocused, and covers tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Chat GPT depending on the path that you choose. Now, they've got thousands of five-star reviews, recommendations from Switch up Course Support, and Forbes, and tons of success stories from students that have completely changed their career after going through the program. Now, if you're serious about getting into AI or ML, then definitely check out Simply Learns Programs. Click the link in the description or the pinned comment to take your first step towards your next big career move. Now, moving on to step number two, and this one I would try to do fairly quickly, and that's to become data literate. What I mean by this is just being familiar working with data. So, I'd want to learn some basic SQL like some joins, some select statements. What actually is SQL? How do you work with this? I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

                    "transcript": "Remember how back in the day people would Google themselves, you type your name into a search engine and you see what it knows about you? Well, the modern equivalent of that is to do the same thing with a chatbot. So when I ask a large language model, who is Martin Keen? Well, the response varies greatly depending upon which model I'm asking, because different models, they have different training data sets, they have a different knowledge cutoff dates. So what a given model knows about me, well, it differs greatly. But how could we improve the model's answer? Well, there's three ways. So let's start with a model here, and we're gonna see how we can improve its responses. Well, the first thing it could do is it could go out and it could perform a search, a search for new data that either wasn't in its training data set, or it was just data that became available after the model finished training, and then it could incorporate those results from the search back into its answer. That is called RAG or Retrieval Augmented Generation. That's one method. Or we could pick a specialized model, a model that's been trained on, let's say, transcripts of these videos. That would be an example of something called fine tuning, or we could ask the model a query that better specifies what we're looking for. So maybe the LLM already knows plenty about the Martin Keens of the world, but let's tell the model that we're referring to the Martin keen who works at IBM, rather than the Martin Keen that founded Keen Shoes. That is an example of prompt engineering. Three ways to get better outputs out of large language models, each with their pluses and minuses. Let's start with RAG. So let's break it down. First there's retrieval. So retrieval of external up-to-date information. Then there's augmentation. That's augmentation of the original prompt with the retrieved information added in. And then finally there's generation. That's generation of a response based on all of this enriched context. So we can think of it like this. So we start with a query and the query comes in to a large language model. Now, what RAG is gonna do is it's first going to go searching through a corpus of information. So we have this corpus here full of some sort of data. Now, perhaps, that's your organization's documents. So it might be spreadsheets, PDFs, internal wikis, you know, stuff like that, But unlike a typical search engine that just matches keywords, RAG converts both your question, the query, and all of the documents into something called vector embeddings. So these are all converted into vectors. essentially turning words and phrases into long lists of numbers that capture their meaning. So when you ask a query like, what was our company's revenue growth last quarter? Well, RAG will find documents that are mathematically similar in meaning to your question, even if they don't use the exact same words. So it might find documents mentioning fourth quarter performance or quarterly sales. Those don't contain the keyword revenue growth, but they are semantically similar. Now, once RAG finds the relevant information, it adds this information back into your original query before passing it to the language model. So instead of the model just kind of guessing based on its training data, it can now generate a response that incorporates your actual facts and figures. So this makes RAG particularly valuable when you are looking for information that is up to date, and it's also very valuable when you need in to add in information that is domain specific as well, but there are some costs to this. Let's go with the red pen. So one cost, that would be the cost of performance. for performing all of this, because you have this retrieval step here, and that adds latency to each query compared to a simple prompt to a model. There are also costs related to just kind of the processing of this as well. So if we think about what we're having to do here, we've got documents that need to be vector embeddings, and we need to store these vector embedding in a database. All of this adds to processing costs, it adds to infrastructure costs to make this solution work. All right, next up, fine tuning. So remember how we discussed getting better answers about me by training a model specifically on, let's say, my video transcripts. Well, that is fine tuning in action. So what we do with fine tuning is we take a model, but specifically an existing model. and that existing model has broad knowledge. And then we're gonna give it additional specialized training on a focused data set. So this is now specialized to what we want to develop particular expertise on. Now, during fine tuning, we're updating the model's internal parameters through additional training. So the model starts out with some weights here. like this, and those weights were optimized during its initial pre-training. And as we fine tune, we're making small adjustments here to the model's weights using this specialized data set. So this is being incorporated. Now this process typically uses supervised learning where we provide input-output pairs that demonstrate the kind of responses we want. So for example, if we're fine-tuning for technical support, we might provide thousands of examples of customer queries, and those would be paired with correct technical responses. The model adjusts its weights through back propagation to minimize the difference between its predicted outputs and the targeted responses. So we're not just teaching the model new facts here, we're actually modifying how it processes information. The model is learning to recognize domain-specific patterns. So, fine-tuning shows its strength when you particularly need a model that has very deep domain expertise. That's what we can really add in with fine tuning, and also, it's much faster, specifically at inference time. So when we are putting the queries in, it's faster than RAG because it doesn't need to search through external data, and because the knowledge is kind of baked into the model's weights, you don't need to maintain a separate vector database, but there's some downsides as well. Well, there's certainly issues here with the training complexity of all of this. You're going to need thousands of high quality training examples. There are also issues with computational cost. The computational cost for training this model can be substantial and is going to require a whole bunch of GPUs. And there's also challenges related to maintenance as well because unlike RAG where you can easily add new documents to your knowledge base at any point. Updating a fine-tune model requires another round of training and then perhaps most importantly of all there is a risk of something called catastrophic forgetting. Now that's when the model loses some of its general capabilities while it's busy learning these specialized ones. So finally let's explore prompt engineering. Now specifying Martin Keen who works at IBM versus Martin Keene who founded Keene Shoes, that's prompt engineering, but at its most basic. Prompt engineering goes far beyond simple clarification. So let's think about when we input a prompt, the model receives this prompt and it processes it through a series of layers, and these layers are essentially tension mechanisms and each one focuses on different aspects of your prompt text that came in. And by including specific elements in your prompt, so examples or context or how you want the format to look, you're directing the model's attention to relevant patterns it learned during training. So for example, telling a model to think about this step-by-step, that activates patterns it learnt from training data where methodical reasoning led to accurate results. So a well-engineered prompt can transform a model's output without any additional training or without data retrieval. So take an example of a prompt. Let's say we say, is this code secure? Not a very good prompt. An engineered prompt, it might read a bit more like this. It's much more detailed. Now. We haven't changed the model, we haven't added new data, we've just better activated its existing capabilities. Now I think the benefits to this are pretty obvious. One is that we don't need to change any of our back-end infrastructure here because there are no infrastructure changes at all in order to prompt better, it's all on the user. There's also the benefit that by doing this, You get to see immediate responses and immediate results to what you do. We don't have to add in new training data or any kind of data processing, but of course there are some limitations to this as well. Prompt engineering is as much an art as it is a science. So there is certainly a good amount of trial and error in this sort of process to find effective prompts, and you're also limited in what you can do here, you're limited to existing knowledge because you're not able to actually add anything else in here. No additional amount of prompt engineering is going to teach it truly new information. You're not going to the model anything that's outdated in the model. So we've talked about now RAG as being one option and we talked about fine tuning as being another one. And now, just now, we've talked about prompt engineering as well and I've really talked about those as three different distinct things here, but they're commonly used actually in combination. We might use all three together. So consider a legal AI system. RAG, that could retrieve specific cases and recent court decisions. The prompt engineering part, that could make sure that we follow proper legal document formats by asking for it. And then fine-tuning, that can help the model master firm-specific policies. I mean, basically, we can think of it like this. We can think that prompt engineering offers flexibility and immediate results, but it can't extend knowledge. RAG, that can extend knowledge, it provides up-to-date information, but with computational overhead. and then fine-tuning, that enables deep domain expertise, but it requires significant resources and maintenance. Basically, it comes down to picking the methods that work for you. You know, we've, we sure come a long way from vanity searching on Google."

I’m Jack Erickson, and through this series I’ll try to demystify model optimization techniques, and I’ll show you how to get started using them with Intel Neural Compressor, so whether you’re using PyTorch TensorFlow or any other framework supported by Intel Neural Compressor, it will be the same API. Let’s start by answering – What is AI Model Optimization?\nAs AI models grow in terms of capabilities, they’re also becoming larger and more compute-intensive. How can we deploy these capabilities to smaller, more power-efficient edge devices, and deliver results quickly? Model optimization techniques trade off a little bit of accuracy to reduce model size and latency. There are a few basic ways to optimize a model - remember, neural networks are dominated by \n- remember, neural networks are dominated by matrix multiply-accumulates, typically 32-bit floating point. There are a few main categories of model optimization techniques, and we will cover how each reduces either the amount of data, the amount of multiplication operations, or both, while maintaining sufficient accuracy. Quantization reduces the word lengths of the weights and/or activations, which of course reduces their precision or dynamic range. If you convert to a smaller floating-point format, you can get some speedup without much precision loss. Quantizing to 8-bit integer further reduces data size. But this also has a larger impact on precision, so it might require some amount of training to achieve sufficient accuracy. Pruning techniques seek to eliminate parameters that have minimal effect on the model’s results. For instance weights that fall below a certain threshold can be zeroed out, reducing the size of the parameters and reducing arithmetic operations. Or activations that fall below a threshold can trigger pruning of an entire neuron, greatly reducing both the size of the parameters and the number of calculations, again speeding up inference. So this can significantly compress a model, but it will require some amount of re-training after pruning. With knowledge distillation, you train a small efficient model to mimic the results of a large complex model. So starting with that large, or “teacher” model, which is already trained and frozen, you train the smaller “student” model with the same data, comparing its accuracy to the ”teacher” by creating an evaluation function. This technique does require training of the student model, as well as a good understanding of network architectures in order to create the right student model. Neural Architecture Search aims to automate the process of converging on a good student model, by first building a “super net” model from which multiple smaller architectures can be extracted. This requires extensive training – first of the large super net, then of the best resulting student architecture.This was a brief overview of the current set of model optimization techniques. Choosing the right approach for your application will depend on how much compression you need, and how much you are able to invest into exploring tradeoffs and training. These are all available with Intel Neural Compressor, with the same API across PyTorch, TensorFlow, or ONNX. You can learn more at the links below the video or by scanning the QR code here. Subsequent videos in this series will go into more details on each technique, and will illustrate how to use them with Intel Neural Compressor."

                    "transcript": "AI is changing extremely fast in 2025 and so is the way that you should be learning it. So, in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how I would learn AI and ML if I was starting completely from scratch with all of the knowledge that I have today. Let's get into it. Now, the first thing or step zero on my list would be to make sure that I was thinking like an engineer. Now look, there's a long list of topics that I'm going to share with you here. All things that are important to learn. But none of them matter if you don't build that deep critical thinking skill. The things that separate good software engineers from great software engineers are the ability to break down problems and to think critically. So as you listen to this list, keep in mind that it's not about memorizing concepts. It's about truly understanding what's going on and being able to solve abstract complex problems, which is really where humans come in and where we're not yet being replaced by AI models. Anyways with step zero out of the way, the first thing that I would be focusing on is really diving deep into Python. Now look, obviously there's all kinds of no code tools out there, but if you want to be an effective AI or ML engineer, I do believe that you still do need to know how to code. And the best way to do that is to start with Python. Python is just the easiest language to learn. It's the best for AI and ML. And personally, if I was diving into this, I would be focusing on learning the fundamentals skipping all of the advanced theory, and building automation projects as quickly as possible. That's what Python is really good at, automating tasks, doing things like data science. So, I would start with things like scripting or scraping. So, web scraping for example. Then I would get into things like numpy mapplot, lib, and pandas. and just get really competent working with data sets within Python. I would also focus on learning the basics of APIs. So, how to make a very simple one and how to call APIs from Python. I'd be doing all of this with the goal of building projects as quickly as possible, not getting into the weeds of all of the theoretical concepts and really just getting comfortable writing code in Python so I can use this as a tool later on when I dive more into the advanced AI and ML stuff. So, that's step one. get comfortable with Python and do it in a practical way using a lot of the tools that I just mentioned. That's personally what I would be doing. And by the way guys, what I'm sharing with you here is not necessarily what I would do if I was trying to land a job, but it's purely what I would do to get good at this as quickly as possible. Now, with that in mind, if you are trying to land an AI or ML job, something that you're going to struggle with is finding a program that teaches you practical skills, but actually balances that with real world credibility. Now, that's why I was quite impressed when I came across SimplyLearn, the sponsor of today's video. Now, this is a world's leading online platform for tech and business education, and they've got a full catalog of hands-on boot camps, and their AI and machine learning programs are seriously well put together. These are live instructor-led classes, not just videos, and they're built in collaboration with some of the world's top universities and companies.

Now, if you're serious about getting into AI or ML, then definitely check out Simply Learns Programs. Click the link in the description or the pinned comment to take your first step towards your next big career move. Now, moving on to step number two, and this one I would try to do fairly quickly, and that's to become data literate. What I mean by this is just being familiar working with data. So, I'd want to learn some basic SQL like some joins, some select statements. What actually is SQL? How do you work with this? I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

ZACK AKIL: We're going to\ncover beginner, intermediate, and advanced ways of\ndoing machine learning. POLONG LIN: Beginner is\nperfect for those brand new to machine learning\nand who want to use it without the expertise. ZACK AKIL: And\nintermediate is for those that have some knowledge\nof machine learning but may want to\ncustomize their models. POLONG LIN: Advanced is\nfor the ML engineer who wants to take their\nskills or knowledge to the next level with\nfull customizability and at the enterprise\ngrade scale. ZACK AKIL: And we're\ngoing to give you links for each of these tools\nwhere you can learn more. Let's get started. POLONG LIN: Hey, Zack. I'm trying to build a\nprototype to classify images, specifically for identifying\nflower species based on some photos I have. I don't have a\nlot of photos yet. But I really just\nwant the fastest way to get a quick proof of\nconcept out the door. What could I use? ZACK AKIL: That sounds\nlike a perfect use case for Teachable Machine. It's a browser-based tool that\nlets you build image or audio classifiers in just\na couple of minutes. And what's really\ngreat about it is that you can capture training\ndata directly from your webcam or microphone right away. You can see here we're\nuploading our flower images and training a brand new\nmodel right in the browser. And once the model\nis trained, we can make predictions right in\nthe browser to test it out. Also, by the end of this, we'll\nhave a full machine learning model that we can export. And this model is a\nTensorFlow Lite model, which means we can deploy it\nanywhere, like mobile, web, or even in the Cloud. So that's Teachable\nMachine, the perfect tool for your prototypes. POLONG LIN: All right, Zack. I'm trying to build an\nenterprise grade image classification model. But I don't really\nhave the expertise. And my model needs to be\nreally accurate and scale well. I'm not a data scientist\nor ML engineer. But I already have a label\ndata set ready to go. What can I use? ZACK AKIL: Ah, now that\nsounds like a perfect use case for AutoML in Vertex AI. It's a machine-learning tool for\ndevelopers on Google Cloud that allows you to train custom\nenterprise grade models based on your own data. You can use it to\nbuild models to predict on your images, video,\ntext, or even tabular data. And because it's\npart of Vertex AI, you can easily deploy your\nmodels for large scale batch and real time predictions. POLONG LIN: Hey, Mr.\nZack, I'm a developer. And I have an app where I\nwant to add some ML powered capabilities without\nneeding to build or deploy any models myself-- specific tasks like\nimage-labeling, sentiment analysis, or\ntext classification. What can I use that just\nworks out of the box? ZACK AKIL: Ah,\nexcellent question. I think some of the pre-trained\nML APIs would be perfect. These are powerful\npre-trained models that allow you to embed machine\nlearning capabilities directly into your applications with\njust a single API call. You can see here how there\nare great common tasks like sentiment analysis\nin text, object and person detection in video, and\neven some really cool things like landmark\ndetection in photos. And there's loads\nof other features that I haven't even mentioned. So definitely check out\nthe ML APIs in Vertex AI. POLONG LIN: Hey, Zack. I want to generate\nimages and text. Where can I begin? ZACK AKIL: Now that\nsounds like a perfect use case for Generative AI Studio. It is a managed\nenvironment in Vertex AI that makes it easy to\ndeploy, interact with, and tune generative\nmodels to production. It's got a simple interface\nfor prompt design, tuning, and deployment for\ndevelopers to get started building\nwith generative AI. Let's walk through an example. Let's say I have some blog\ncontent around healthy granola bars. And I want to generate a\nmultimedia marketing campaign around this. Using just the\nblog content, I can write a prompt and Generative\nAI Studio will generate a blog title, headline, and Instagram\ncaption with hashtags for a marketing campaign. And there you have a blog\nheadline, a blog post, and an Instagram content\nfor our campaign. No ML expertise required. And you can also view the\nAPI code to use Generative AI Studio programmatically. We can also use Vertex's\ngenerative vision AI capabilities. With our image\ngeneration model, I can use the simple text\nprompts to generate images that go along with\nmy marketing campaign. You can see here a\nprompt being used to generate multiple images of a\ngranola bar on a kitchen table. And then we can then\nuse these images in our marketing campaign. And that's just one\nexample of how you can use Generative AI Studio. But note, you can also tune\nthe foundation model as well. Hey, Polong, I'm looking\nfor a single place where I can search,\ndiscover, and use models that might be available\nto me on Google Cloud. Where can I go for this? POLONG LIN: Ah,\nfor that use case, you might really like\nVertex AI Model Garden. It provides a single\nenvironment to search, discover, and interact with curated\nmodels both from Google and open source. For Model Garden, you can kick\noff a variety of workflows, including using the\nmodel directly as an API, tuning the model in\nGenerative AI Studio, or deploying the model\ndirectly to a data science notebook in Vertex AI. We've also just\nlaunched four new APIs that will be available\nin the Model Garden. We've announced our code\ngeneration and completion models, which can help\nwith software development. We've also announced an\nimage generation model, which includes the ability\nto edit and iterate over images you've generated. We've also announced\nour universal speech model, which is the next\ngeneration of speech to text. And then we've also\nannounced an embedding model, which lets you\nextract embeddings from unstructured data. ZACK AKIL: Hey, Polong. I wish I had a way to tune\nmy models to understand my preferences in the way\nthat they respond to me. What should I do? POLONG LIN: Well, I heard\nthat GCP is coming out with a new capability\ncalled reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback, or RLHF for short. With RLHF, you can\ntune your models to learn directly from\npositive or negative feedback and use that to optimize the\nperformance of your models. Be on the lookout for more news\nabout this exciting capability later this year. ZACK AKIL: Hey, Polong. I've already got a lot\nof data in BigQuery. And ideally, I'd like to\nuse this data to train my own machine learning models. But I'm not quite\nsure where to begin. POLONG LIN: Well, that\nsounds like a perfect use case for BigQuery ML. Using just SQL, you can train,\nevaluate, make predictions, all within BigQuery without\nneeding to move your data out of your data warehouse. So in this example, you can\ncreate a classification model in SQL with a create\nmodel statement, then make predictions\nusing an ML.predict query. You can even use\nBigQuery ML directly on your unstructured data via an\nexciting new capability called BigQuery ML inference engine. So say you have\nunstructured data like image files stored\nin Google Cloud Storage, but your primary workflow\nis all through BigQuery, so now using BigQuery\nML inference engine, you can run inference directly\non data stored in Cloud Storage through BigQuery. Your models could be\nimported TensorFlow models, XG boost models, ONNX models,\nor even a custom Vertex AI endpoint that you have deployed. And if you don't\nhave a model at hand, you can use the\npre-trained ML APIs like the vision, natural\nlanguage, and translate APIs. Check out the BigQuery ML\nlink for more information. ZACK AKIL: Yo, Polong, I\nwant to get my hands dirty and play around with machine\nlearning libraries in Python. How do I get started\nas quick as possible? POLONG LIN: As\nquick as possible? That sounds like a perfect\nuse case for Colab. In seconds, you can\ncreate a Colab notebook and start using Python\ndirectly in the browser. You can import or install\nyour favorite libraries. And you can even load notebooks\nor code that you found online or check out some of\nthese sample notebooks. You can also use Colab\nwith Google Cloud like reading data from BigQuery. So check out Colab\nin the link below. ZACK AKIL: All right, Polong. I've played around with Colab,\nand I'm loving the notebook environment. But I'm an enterprise developer. And now I want to think\nabout production workloads. And I also want to\nthink about integrations with the rest of Google Cloud. What can I do? POLONG LIN: That's\na great question. And it sounds like you\nmight get a kick out of Vertex AI Workbench. You can create and customize\nJupyterLab instances on Google Cloud. So here you can\nsee some instances with just Python and others\nwith TensorFlow or PyTorch pre-installed with\nGPUs attached. And as you open\nan instance, it's the familiar Jupyter\nNotebook interface. You can create new instances\nand customize things like the size of your machine\nand location and permissions. And it's got great integrations\nwith the rest of Google Cloud because it's part\nof Google Cloud. ZACK AKIL: I'm a\nmachiner and engineer. And I need an enterprise grade\nway to train my custom models at scale. What can I use? POLONG LIN: Well,\nZack, might I say that is a perfect use case\nfor Vertex AI custom training. You can bring your ML\ncode and run it in a Cloud with Vertex AI. You can keep track of\nyour model experiments, use automated\nhyperparameter tuning, and leverage ML op's\ncapabilities of Vertex AI like orchestrating your\nmodel training and deployment workflows with\nVertex AI pipelines. So imagine that I\nhave a model that I've been training in a\nnotebook environment for experimentation. And maybe once I'm\ncloser to production, or if I have really\nheavy training workloads, then I might just\ntrain directly using Vertex AI custom training. So I containerized my\ncode, then submit it to Vertex AI custom training\nto run it for me in a managed and repeatable way. So find out more about\nVertex AI custom training in the link on the screen. Hey Zack. I'm an enterprise developer. And I want to build\na fast AI powered search based on unstructured\ndata, using embeddings. What can I use? ZACK AKIL: Ah, embeddings, that\nsounds like a perfect use case for Vertex AI matching engine. It's our highly optimized vector\ndatabase that stores and does fast lookups of embeddings. But what does this mean? Well, in this example, we have\ntwo million random images. And we want to search for\nthe images that look the most similar to this yellow car. So the matching engine will\ndo an extremely fast lookup by finding the nearest\nembeddings to the embedding of this yellow car. And then it's going to return\nthe results in milliseconds. Because it's embeddings, we\ncan use a variety of data types like text, images, video,\naudio, or anything else that you can convert\ninto embeddings. Vertex AI matching engine even\nsupports real time updates so that you can make\nnew data immediately searchable without needing to\nreindex the entire database. POLONG LIN: Awesome. So that was the final\nitem on our list of 10 ways of doing machine\nlearning with Google Cloud. Check out the links to learn\nmore about each of the 10 ways. ZACK AKIL: Thank you\nso much for watching. And enjoy the rest\nof Google I/O. [MUSIC PLAYING]"
