                    "transcript": "hello and welcome back to data science\nWednesday my name is Tessa Jones and I'm a data scientist with decisive data and\ntoday we're going to talk about predictive analytics and what it can do\nfor you predictive analytics fits into the\nspectrum of analytics that we've talked about before starting with descriptive\nwhich is the most basic of the analytics it is basically just cleaning relating\nsummarizing and visualizing your data really getting to the questions about\nwhat's happening in my business and then there's diagnostic which is really\ngetting down to why things are happening what's causing my revenue to decline or\nto increase how are things related things like that so if you've got a good\nbase in both of these then we're ready to move into predictive analytics which\nis gonna dive into what's gonna happen in the future which is super powerful if\nyou're a business person and you want to be able to make good business questions\nif you have at least an idea of what might happen in the future your your\nanswers are already gonna be a little bit better so let's dive in so let's go\nwith an example cuz that just makes it easier to kind of flow through what's\nactually happening here so let's pretend that we are grocery store owners and if\nwe're already talking about predictive analytics you should have a pretty good\ngrasp on descriptive and predictive and diagnostic analytics so you probably\nalready have a decent dashboard that really tells you what's happening in\nyour business right now so something like this where you have you know\nsomething here that tells you revenue by different departments like foods meats\nor foods and pastry or how your sales changes by product or overtime things\nlike that so you have an idea of what's happening in your business but now you\nreally want to know what's going to happen in my business so one really\ncommon question is how many of a given product am I going to sell for every\nstore because this can really give you quite answer questions around how you're\ngoing to support supply chain processes or how you're going to manage the\nprofits that you're going to have things like that so the first thing we need to\ndo is talk about what happened past we really can't do anything or\npredict very easily unless we know or at least have an idea of what's happened in\nthe past so here we have three lines in black that represent basically\nhistorical data each line here is one year worth of sales for a given product\nand then the green line here is the current year and here's today and if we\nbuild a predictive model it's going to tell us what's going to happen for the\nrest of the year so if this is all set up and we build a model basically we mix\nthis information with all the data that's really clean and well-organized\nwe mash it together with a bunch of mathematics and coding and basically we\npop out some results and it shows up in a visual like this where you have these\nare the cells that we have had and these are the cells that we think we're going\nto have so a business person can look at this chart and say wow we need to put a\nlot more products to this store because I see sales are going to increase or our\nprofit margins are going to be way higher than we thought so we can start a\nnew program things like that you can really start to get innovative with your\nbusiness decisions so let's pretend we've built this model and it's been\nrunning for a year and now we want to know how well is this model actually\nperforming so down here we have a chart that shows in black what we actually\nsold and then in green what we thought we were going to sell and we see that\nthere's some a couple of pretty big misses right here we sold way more than\nwe thought we would which leaves risk to you know missing out on inventory or\nhere we predicted we would sell more way more than we did so both of these are\nkind of misses and so we need to go back and look at the data and understand what\nassumptions we we applied that we're maybe a little bit wrong or applied\nincorrectly or look at the data maybe we weren't accounting for something and we\nkind of reorganize that and incorporate it into the model and then we redeploy\nit and then the then we have a better model this cycle can you know happen a\ncouple times or it can happen many it really depends on the data it really\ndepends on the objective it depends on a lot of different things but we do try to\nminimize the number of times that we're having to iterate through this before we\ncan have a really sound predictive model so that's predictive analytics in a\nnutshell basically once you have a solid foundation of descriptive and diagnostic\nanalytics we can really start pushing forward with predictive analytics and\nthen next week we're going to start talking about prescriptive analytics\nwhich really gets to the questions of okay now that we know what's happening\nin the future what do we do about it I'm Tessa Jones and that's a reindeer"

                    "transcript": "my SmartWatch tracks how much sleep I get each night if I'm feeling curious I can look on my phone and see my nightly Slumber plotted on a graph it might look something like this and on the graph on the y-axis we have the hours of sleep and then on the x-axis we have days and this is an example of a Time series and what a Time series is is data of the same entity like my sleep hours collected at regular intervals like over days and when we have time series we can perform a Time series analysis and this is where we analyze the timestamp data to extract meaningful insights and predictions about the future and while it's super useful to forecast that I'm going to probably get like seven hours shut eye tonight based on the data time series analysis plays a significant role in helping organizations drive a Better Business decisions so for example using time series analysis a retailer can use this functionality to predict future sales and optimize their inventory levels conversely if you're into purchasing a purchaser can use time series analysis to predict commodity prices and make informed purchasing decisions and then in fields like agriculture we can use time series analysis to predict weather patterns influencing decisions on harvesting and when to plant so let's first of all introduce number one the components of Time series analysis and then number two we're going to take a look at some of the forecasting models for performing time series analysis and then number three we're going to talk about how to implement some of this stuff okay now let's talk about the components first of all and one component is called trend now this component refers to the overall direction of the data over time whether it's increasing whether it's decreasing perhaps it's staying the same so you can think of it like a line on the graph that's either going up or going down or staying flat that's the first component the second one seasonality now this component is a repeating pattern of data over a set period of time like the way that retail sales Spike during the holiday season so we might see a spike and then a bit lower the spike is back and it keeps repeating like that that's seasonality third component that's cycle and cycle refers to repeating but non-seasonal patterns in the data so these might be economic booms and busts that happen over several years or maybe even decades so it's a much smoother curve and then lastly there is variation and variation refers to the unpredictable ups and downs in the data that cannot be explained by these other components and this component is also known as irregularity or noise and well it looks like maybe that yeah very difficult to pick out the trend so those are some of the components of Time series but let's talk about the forecasting models that we can use to perform some analysis and there are several popular forecasting models out there one of the most well known is called the arima model now arima that stands for auto regressive integrated moving average and the model is made up of three components so there's the the AR part that's the auto regressive component and that looks at how past values affect future values then there's the I for integrated or differencing components and that accounts for Trends and seasonality and then there is the m a component that's the moving average component and that Smooths out the Noise by removing non-deterministic or random movements from a Time series so that's arima another pretty popular one you'll often see is called exponential smoothing and exponential smoothings model is is used to forecast time series data that doesn't have a clear Trend or seasonality so it doesn't fit into these kind of areas and this model works by smoothing out the data by giving more weight to recent values and less weight to older values and there are many other forecasting models out there and the right one to use of course depends on the data you're working with and the specific problem you're trying to solve okay so that's finally talk a little bit about implementation how do we implement this there are several software packages out there that can help you perform time series analysis and forecasting such as those with r and Python and Matlab so if we just focus in on on python for a moment two of the most popular libraries for time series analysis in Python firstly pandas and secondly a library called mat plot lied with pandas you can easily import manipulate and analyze the time series data and it can handle things like missing values aggregate data and perform statistical analysis on the data Matt plot live is a library that can help you visualize the time series data you can create line charts or Scatter Plots and heat Maps using these libraries you can perform a wide range of Time series analysis tasks like data cleaning exploratory data analysis and modeling you can use pandas to pre-process your time series data and then use mat plus live to visualize the trends and seasonalities in that data look by understanding the components of a Time series and then choosing the right forecasting model you can make more informed decisions and gain a competitive Advantage so look whether you're a data analyst or a business owner or just a curious sleeper take advantage of the power of Time series analysis and get a glimpse into what the future may hold if you have any questions please drop us a line below and if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like And

                    "transcript": "AI is changing extremely fast in 2025 and so is the way that you should be learning it. So, in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how I would learn AI and ML if I was starting completely from scratch with all of the knowledge that I have today. Let's get into it. Now, the first thing or step zero on my list would be to make sure that I was thinking like an engineer. Now look, there's a long list of topics that I'm going to share with you here. All things that are important to learn. But none of them matter if you don't build that deep critical thinking skill. The things that separate good software engineers from great software engineers are the ability to break down problems and to think critically. So as you listen to this list, keep in mind that it's not about memorizing concepts. It's about truly understanding what's going on and being able to solve abstract complex problems, which is really where humans come in and where we're not yet being replaced by AI models. Anyways with step zero out of the way, the first thing that I would be focusing on is really diving deep into Python. Now look, obviously there's all kinds of no code tools out there, but if you want to be an effective AI or ML engineer, I do believe that you still do need to know how to code. And the best way to do that is to start with Python. Python is just the easiest language to learn. It's the best for AI and ML. And personally, if I was diving into this, I would be focusing on learning the fundamentals skipping all of the advanced theory, and building automation projects as quickly as possible. That's what Python is really good at, automating tasks, doing things like data science. So, I would start with things like scripting or scraping. So, web scraping for example. Then I would get into things like numpy mapplot, lib, and pandas. and just get really competent working with data sets within Python. I would also focus on learning the basics of APIs. So, how to make a very simple one and how to call APIs from Python. I'd be doing all of this with the goal of building projects as quickly as possible, not getting into the weeds of all of the theoretical concepts and really just getting comfortable writing code in Python so I can use this as a tool later on when I dive more into the advanced AI and ML stuff. So, that's step one. get comfortable with Python and do it in a practical way using a lot of the tools that I just mentioned. That's personally what I would be doing. And by the way guys, what I'm sharing with you here is not necessarily what I would do if I was trying to land a job, but it's purely what I would do to get good at this as quickly as possible. Now, with that in mind, if you are trying to land an AI or ML job, something that you're going to struggle with is finding a program that teaches you practical skills, but actually balances that with real world credibility. Now, that's why I was quite impressed when I came across SimplyLearn, the sponsor of today's video. Now, this is a world's leading online platform for tech and business education, and they've got a full catalog of hands-on boot camps, and their AI and machine learning programs are seriously well put together. These are live instructor-led classes, not just videos, and they're built in collaboration with some of the world's top universities and companies. The curriculum is projectbased careerfocused, and covers tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Chat GPT depending on the path that you choose. Now, they've got thousands of five-star reviews, recommendations from Switch up Course Support, and Forbes, and tons of success stories from students that have completely changed their career after going through the program. Now, if you're serious about getting into AI or ML, then definitely check out Simply Learns Programs. Click the link in the description or the pinned comment to take your first step towards your next big career move. Now, moving on to step number two, and this one I would try to do fairly quickly, and that's to become data literate. What I mean by this is just being familiar working with data. So, I'd want to learn some basic SQL like some joins, some select statements. What actually is SQL? How do you work with this? I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

are those differences and deep learning is another one that comes into play I actually did a video on these three artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning and talked about where they fit and there were a lot of comments on that and I read those comments and I'd like to address some of the most frequently asked questions so that we clear up some of the myths and misconceptions around this in addition something else has happened since that video was recorded and that is this the absolute explosion of this area of generative AI things like large language models and chat Bots have seemed to be taking over the world we see them everywhere really interesting technology uh and then also things like deep fakes these are all within the realm of AI but how do they fit within each other how are they related to each other we're going to take a look at that in this video and try to explain how all these Technologies relate and how we can use them first off a little bit of a disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify some of these Concepts in order to not make this video last for a week so those of you that are really deep experts in the field apologies in advance but we're going to try to make this simple and and that will involve some generalizations first of all let's start with AI artificial intelligence is basically trying to simulate with a computer something that would match or exceed human intelligence what is intelligence well it could be a lot of different things but generally we tend to think of it as the ability to learn to infer and to reason things like that so that's what we're trying to do in the broad field of AI of artificial intelligence and if we look at a timeline of AI it really kind of started back around on this time frame and in those days it was very premature most people had not even heard of it uh and uh it basically was a research project but I can tell you uh as an undergrad which for me was back during these times uh we were doing AI work in fact we would use programming languages like lisp uh or prologue uh and these kinds of things uh were kind of the predecessors to what became later expert systems and this was a technology again some of these things existed previous but that's when it really uh hit kind of a critical mass and became more popularized so expert systems of the 1980s maybe in the 90s and and again we use Technologies like this all of this uh was was something that we did before we ever touched in to the next topic I'm going to talk about and that's the area of machine learning machine learning is as its name implies the machine is learning I don't have to program it I give it lots of information and and it observes things so for instance if I start doing this if I give you this and then ask you to predict what's the next thing that's going to be there well you might get it you might not you have very limited training data to base this on but if I gave you one of those and then ask you what to predict would happen next well you're probably going to say this and then you're going to say it's this and then you think you got it all figured out and then you see one of these and then all of a sudden I give you one of those and throw you a curveball so this in fact and then maybe it it goes on like this so a machine learning algorithm is really good at looking at patterns and discovering patterns within data the more training data you can give it the more confident it can be in predicting so predictions are one of the things that machine learning is is particularly good at another thing is spotting outliers like this and saying oh that doesn't belong in it looks different than all the other stuff because the sequence was broken so that's particularly useful in cyber security the area that I work in because we're looking for outliers we're looking for users who are using the system in ways that they shouldn't be or ways that they don't typically do so this technology machine learning is particularly useful for us and machine learning really came along uh and became more popularized uh in this time frame uh in the the 2010s uh and again uh back when I was an undergrad riding my dinosaur to class we were doing this kind of stuff we never once talked about machine learning it might have existed but it really wasn't hadn't hit the popular uh mindset yet uh but this technology has matured greatly over the last few decades and now it becomes the basis of a lot we do going forward the next layer of our Vin diagram involves deep learning well it's deep learning in the sense that with deep learning we use these things called neural networks neural networks are ways that in a computer we simulate and mimic the way the human brain works at least to the extent that we understand how the brain works and it's called Deep because we have multiple layers of those neural networks and the interesting thing about these is they will simulate the way a brain operates but I don't know if you've noticed but human brains can be a little bit unpredictable you put certain things in you don't always get the very same thing out and deep learning is the same way in some cases we're not actually able to fully understand why we get the results we do uh because there are so many layers to the neural network it's a little bit hard to to decompose and figure out exactly what's in there but this has become a very important part and a very important advancement that also reached some popularity during the 2010s and as something that we use still today as the basis for our next area of AI the most recent advancements in the field of artificial in intelligence all really are in this space the area of generative AI now I'm going to introduce a term that you may not be familiar with it's the idea of foundation models Foundation models is where we get some of these kinds of things for instance an example of a foundation model would be a large language model which is where we take language and we model it and we make predictions in this technology where if I see certain types of of words then I can sort of predict what the next set of words will be I'm going to oversimplify here for the sake of Simplicity but think about this as a little bit like the autoc complete when you start typing something in and then it predicts what your next word will be except in this case with large language models they're not predicting the next word they're predicting the next sentence the next paragraph the next entire document so there's a really an amazing exponential leap in what these things are able to do and we call all of these Technologies generative because they are generating new content um some people have actually made the argument that the generative AI isn't really generative that that these Technologies are really just regurgitating existing information and putting it in different format well let me give you an analogy um if you take music for instance then every note has already been invented so in a sense every song is just a recombination some other permutation of all the notes that already exist already and just putting them in a different order well we don't say new new music doesn't exist people are still composing and creating new songs from the existing information I'm going to say geni is similar it's a it's an analogy so there'll be some imperfections in it but you get the general idea actually new content can be generated out of these and there are a lot of different forms that this can take with other types of models are uh Audio models uh video models and things like that well in fact these we can use to create deep fakes and deep fakes are examples where we're able to take for instance a person's voice and recreate that and then have it seem like the person said things they never said well it's really useful in entertainment situations uh in parities and things like that uh or if someone's losing their voice then you could capture their voice and then they'd be able to type and you'd be able to hear it in their voice but there's also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused um the chat Bots again come from this space the Deep fakes come from this space but they're all part of generative Ai and all part of these Foundation models and this again is the area that has really caused all of us to really pay attention to AI the possibilities of generating new content or in some cases summarizing existing content and giving us uh something that is bite-size and manageable this is what has gotten all of the attention this is where the chat Bots and all of these things come in in the early days ai's adoption started off pretty slowly most people didn't even know it existed and if they did it was something that always seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years away but then machine learning deep learning and things like that came along and we started seeing some uptake then Foundation models gen Ai and the light came along and this stuff went straight to the Moon these Foundation models are what have changed the adoption curve and now you see AI being adopted everywhere and the thing for us to understand is where this is where it fits in and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of this technology if you like this video and want to see more like

                    "transcript": "here's how I'd become a data analyst if I had to start over as a data analyst now with over 10 years experience I have many Lessons Learned and would take a completely different path anyone yes you can be a data analyst all within 6 months of self-study here's how by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail says Benjamin Franklin and without a plan you will get lost in the data analyst Journey so here is a 6mon road map that I personally would use I'd split up the road map into three different parts the skills the projects and the job applications and put a date on the calendar 6 months from now and work backwards from it so in months one to three I will work on skills in month four I would work on projects and then month five and six is the job application process and 6 months is very reasonable if you have about 3 to 4 hours to study every day and everybody has different schedules and different commitments but if that's something that you can commit to this Roat would work for you I also have a video on how I was able to self-study for 4 hours every day and if you're looking for tips there I will link the video above months 1 through three is skills knowing what I know today I would really just focus on learning three tools and that is Excel SQL and Tapo I would learn it in that order and just focus on just those three for 3 months I'm not including python Cloud technology other bi tools because most entry-level data analyst roles will only require you to know those three skills that I listed and from my personal experience as well those were the only three tools I used for years so that is enough to get you started and you can worry about learning the other skills after you Le the job Excel is the first tool that I would learn because Excel is still the most popular bi tool used across Industries and it's highly likely that in your first role as a data analyst you'll be using a lot of excel you need to know how to clean analyze and present data using Excel and what level do you need about an intermediate level where you know key functions like vup pivot tables how to create visualizations and what I would do in my road map is break it down into smaller pieces so spend a week learning just the formulas and getting used to them and then spend the following week on visualizations and thinking through how you can visualize data using charts and graphs the best way to learn is by doing rather than moving on to SQL as soon as you finish Excel take the time to practice it what I would do is take my bank statement and try to do some analysis you can try answering questions like what does the trend of my spending look like and this would require taking all your spending and putting it on a line graph where you can see the trend of the increases and decreases of spending over time and then you can try bucketing your spending into categories like entertainment food and chart those categories over time to see how you're spending changes by category over time and this is the type of analysis that a data analyst would do next is seel seel is fundamental to be a data analyst if you have a technical assessment for your data analyst job it will 100% be in SQL data is stored in databases and SQL is a language that you use to talk to databases to get the information that you need SQL is a more powerful tool than Excel because it allows you to work with really large data set and also be able to combine them to easily create different analysis you only need to be an intermediate level SQL user note I didn't say Advanced and that includes functions like select wear Group by having joins and window functions some websites I personally use to learn SQL are data Camp Udi LinkedIn learning data Camp was extremely useful because it allowed me to interactively learn SQL handson without having to download anything as well as LinkedIn learning if you are in the US a lot of public libraries actually offer a free subscription so I was able to do a lot of my learning for free through Linkedin learning and lastly don't forget YouTube because there's a lot of really good free tutorials on YouTube that you should use as well next we move on to Tableau now any bi visualization tool can be used in place of Tableau such as powerbi or looker or quick ey but I personally would learn Tableau because it is the most commonly used tool that you'll see on job listings also from my experience when you start learning just one bi tool you know about 80% of others so it's really not as important which one you pick here so what should you know in Tau you should be about an intermediate user that knows how to connect to data add multiple data sources as well as creating visualizations with filters will get you pretty far there's also a free version of Tableau that you can download and start practicing and you can even take the same bank statement data that you had earlier and use that to create some of the same visualizations to get practice month four is projects this is a step that I wouldn't skip because without any data work experience I don't have anything to show recruiters that I know how to do data analysis so knowing that the purpose of these project projects is to use on my resume and interviews I would strategically use them to make myself stand out here are three tips for your projects tip one I'd create three to four projects that shows a combination of my skills so I wouldn't create a project in just Excel and a project in just SQL I would do a combination of Excel and SQL or SQL in Tableau and this shows the recruiter that I know which tools to use to solve which problems tip number two I create projects that have an analysis that solves a problem and tells a story data analysts always start their process first with the problem and it's no different for a project a common mistake is to start with the data set first with no plan and then work aimlessly without knowing what it is that you're going to do it's like when I'm looking at the bank statement data and without a problem statement I would just take it and create all sorts of fancy graphs that look really good but don't mean anything it's only when I have the problem statement of what does a trend of my spending look like that I actually have a direction and can sit down and think about well how would I best show this through a visualization and tell a story tip number three use free resources for data such as kaggle Reddit data.gov and even corser does have guided projects that you can pay for months 5 through 6 is the job application process I would prepare for interviews by updating my resume my LinkedIn and applying for data analyst jobs and I do have a video on how to create a data analyst resume with actionable tips which I'll leave up there for you to watch while applying for jobs I would start practicing technical questions pretty much every single data analyst job that I applied to has required a SQL technical assessment along with the general interview and I didn't know this and was completely unprepared but you know better so in month 5 give yourself enough time to take some technical test so that when it comes time for the actual interview you'll be ready I've personally used Le code hacker rank for SQL interview questions and they were actually pretty accurate to the ones that I gotten in real life so try and do the medium easy questions and if you can pass those then you'll be prepared with this R map I would start and then learn not learn and then start I hope this is the video that starts you on your data analyst journey and if you're interested in learning more about the soft skills a data analyst uses watch how to get ahead of 99% of data analyst and I will see you there"

                    "transcript": "what's up guys Wale here welcome back to the \nchannel in today's video i'm gonna be talking   about some of the different competencies \nand resources that can be helpful for people   that have no data analysis experience and are \ninterested in getting started in learning data   analysis recently i was discussing with a friend \nwho is quite interested in data analysis and i was   asking him what tool he planned on learning first \nand his answer was python and i asked why python   and he says because it's the hottest tool right \nnow and everyone is talking about it so i know   there's a lot of buzz around learning python to \nbe a data analyst and it's easy to get carried   away with that buzz but try not to get carried \naway rather you want to see through the noise   and find a tool that suits your style and then \nyou can gradually build competence around that   too so i'm going to provide some options to some \nresources which are going to be free extremely   beginner friendly and i'm going to focus on the \ncore competencies to get you started generally   there are four main areas to build competence \nin data analysis and very broadly i list them as   data querying that are cleaning analyzing data \nusing statistical or non-statistical methods   and data visualizations so as a data analyst \nyou'll be required to be knowledgeable using   one or a combination of microsoft excel \nsql tableau or power bi python or r the reason why microsoft excel is first on \nthe list is because if you work in a corporate   organization or plan to work in a corporate \norganization most of the data analysis tasks   you will do will be on microsoft excel typically \nyour colleagues will send you an excel file   to work with and it might be unnecessary \nand sometimes inconvenient to switch   into python to do an analysis that can be \ndone using excel as a beginner data analyst   it is important to learn microsoft excel \nand you should really be aiming to become   knowledgeable in areas involving the use of \nsalt and filter vlookups pivot tables formulas   and basic data cleaning methods to master excel \nfor an absolute beginner here are the courses   i would recommend introduction to data analysis \nusing excel you'll find this course on edx it's   a free course for four weeks where you learn \nhow to use pivot tables aggregate functions   in basic knowledge of formulas cell referencing \nand many more after taking this course then you   can jump into the next course which is also an edx \nwhich is analyzing and visualizing data with excel   here you'll learn how to import data from \ndifferent sources using power query manipulate   your data using dax formulas and prepare for data \nanalysis into power bi one major limitation with   excel is it's limited to one million rows of \ndata so when working with large set of data it   starts to become slow and might crash on you a \nfew times but if your job does not require huge   data set then microsoft excel is good enough \nnonetheless i cannot deny the huge demand for   data analysts with sql and tablet skills so i \nget the need for picking those skills up as well sql is a language that lets you as a \ndata analyst interact with a database   a database is a collection of \ndata stored in a computer system   usually large volumes of data where accessing \nit requires some form of structured coding   as a data analyst you might be required to \nrun sql queries and to do so you must first   understand the basis of relational database \nand structure specifically things like primary   key foreign key relationships between tables \nthen you go ahead and learn sql functions like   select statement from statement where statement \ngroup by order by joins area you want to master   for learning sql again you can check out this edx \ncourse on sql it's called sql for data science   alternatively you can check out khan academy's sql \ncourse called intro to sql querying and managing data the third competence to learn is either one \nof tab u or power bi i just finished learning   tableau and what i discovered was it's not so much \ndifferent from power bi you do basically the same   thing which is to visualize large data sets and \nthe cool thing about both 2 is you can import   your data directly from sql or a csv file or \nany other database to create your visualizations   at this point because you're already \nfamiliar with visualizations using excel   it becomes super easy to understand how \nto use either one of tablet or power bi   to learn power bi once again head over to edx \nenroll for the analyzing and visualizing data with   power bi costs in this course you'll \nlearn how to identify different types   of data visualizations and how to create \nfully functional reports and dashboards   now finally python as a data analyst python is \nused to manipulate data similar to what you do   on sql python is also used in data science for \nhighly mathematical and statistical analysis when   using python what you're really learning is how to \nuse statistics to analyze data remember my friend   who's learning how to use python so far he's \ngotten a hang of some of the theoretical concepts   however there is the practical side which he is \ncurrently struggling with and by practical side   i mean how do you know what sort of problems or \nchallenges that should be solved using statistics   not all analysis requires statistics and that's \nsomething you must be aware of as a data analyst   so some of the basic statistical concepts \nyou should be aware of or you should know   are sampling frequency distribution mean media \nmode measures of variability standard deviation   probability significant testing z-scores \nconfidence intervals and a b testing all these   can be learned and practiced using microsoft excel \ndata analysis 2-pack even before picking up python   class so if you ask me learning python is quite \noptional which is the whole essence of this video   i do not want people to feel they have to learn \npython or r to become data analyst trust me i know   data analysts that have worked solely on excel \nand they are fine even right now as a data analyst   most of the work that i do is a microsoft excel \nand to really show you this here is a data analyst   role on Andela Andela is a renowned technology \nslash i.t talent pool company in Africa and   let's jump straight to the requirements for this \nrole here you have must have deep understanding   of statistics have strong excel skills have \nexperience with sql and database management   have experience with any statistical analysis \npackage such as excel spss and sas so the bottom   line is you can be a data analyst with the \nsimple tools at your disposal start with excel   move over to sql if you need to try \nyour hands on different visualizations   tab your power bi if you're really curious and \nyou want to take it a step higher by all means use   python at the end of the day as long as you can \nuse the tool to get the job done then fantastic you must find ways to apply your knowledge in \nspecific projects to deepen your experience   and showcase your skills without projects you will \nnot be able to retain what you've learned for long   cargo.com is one place to download some \ndata sets and play around with them   apply the knowledge you've learned and experiment \nwith different visualizations it will help   increase your confidence levels significantly \nall right if you have any questions do leave   them down in the comment section below i'd \nbe happy to answer them and if this video   has been helpful to you in any way do smash \nthe like button so that others can benefit   as well thanks for watching and \ni'll see you in the next one"

                    "transcript": "Data science and data analytics. Are they the \nsame thing? Well, you may have seen these terms   used interchangeably, but if I'm mining data from \na large dataset, am I performing data science or   am I performing data analytics? Or what if I'm \ntrying to create a prediction of when my store   will sell out of our current inventory of \ncantaloupes? Well, is that analytics or is   that science? It's worthwhile to understand the \ndifference to better comprehend what these two   fields can do, and also, if you're considering \na career in either field. After all, these are two   different jobs. Somebody who works in the field \nof data science is known as a data scientist.   For data analytics, that role is called a data \nanalyst. Now, this is kind of a trick question   because we can classify everything-- data \nmining, data forecasting and all the rest of   it --as simply data science. And that's because \ndata science is the overarching umbrella term   that covers tasks related to finding patterns in \nlarge datasets, training machine learning models,   and deploying AI applications. Data analytics, it \ncould be argued, is one task that resides under   the data science umbrella. It's a specialization \nof data science, and it focuses on querying,   interpreting and visualizing datasets. Data \nscience is iterative, meaning data scientists form   hypotheses and experiments to see if a desired \noutcome can be achieved using available data.   And that is a process that is known as the data \nscience lifecycle, which usually follows seven   phases. So first is to identify a problem or an \nopportunity. Then the next phase is data mining,   which is to extract data relevant to that problem \nor opportunity from large datasets. Now that data   will likely consist of a bunch of redundancies \nand errors, which is fixed in the next stage,   data cleaning. And then at that point, we move on \nto data exploration analysis to try to make sense   of that data. We'll then apply feature engineering \nusing domain knowledge to extract details from the   data. And predictive modeling comes next to use \nthe data to predict or forecast future outcomes   and behaviors. And then finally, we have data \nvisualization that represents the data points with   graphical tools such as charts and animations. \nAnd so the lifecycle repeats. Now, the role of a   data scientist is an in-demand profession right \nnow. If that's something you're interested in,   you'll want to develop deep skills in machine \nlearning and AI. It's helpful to be able to   write code in languages such as Python--also in R-- \nit's another popular language for data science. And   you should have experience working with big data \nplatforms. So perhaps Hadoop or Apache Spark. And   it's also very helpful to have database knowledge \nand SQL. So that's data science. But what about   its specialization, data analytics? Well, the job \nof a data analyst is to conceptualize a data set   as it currently exists. So we have some data \nhere and we need to do something with it. And   we need to be able to make decisions based on \nthis data. How do we conceptualize it? Well,   four ways. One is through predictive analytics, \nwhich helps to identify trends, correlations and   causation within datasets like forecasting when \nthose cantaloupes would have all flown off the   shelves. Or, in health care, to forecast regions \nwhich will experience a rise in flu cases. There's   prescriptive analytics, and that predicts likely \noutcomes and makes decision recommendations like   predicting when a tire will wear out and need \nto be replaced. There's diagnostic analytics   that helps pinpoint the reason an event occurred. \nManufacturers can analyze a failed component on an   assembly line and figure out the reason behind its \nfailure. And then there is descriptive analytics   which evaluates the qualities and quantities of \na data set. A content streaming provider might   use descriptive analytics to understand how many \nsubscribers it's lost or how many it's gained over   a given period of time and what content is being \nwatched. And while a data scientist is a clearly   defined and specialized role, virtually any \nstakeholder can be a data analyst. For example,   business analysts can use BI dashboards to conduct \nbusiness analytics and visualize KPIs. But many   organizations do employ professional, dedicated \ndata analysts, responsible for data wrangling   and interpreting findings like why a company's \nmarketing campaign didn't meet expectations. If   you want to be a data analyst, it helps to have \nboth analytical and programming skills. So this   includes familiarity with databases. Also, you'll \nneed to know about statistical analysis. And also   data visualization is another important skill. \nSo data analytics is often more focused on using   statistical tools and techniques to interpret \nexisting data and offer actionable insights.   It's usually less concerned with creating \nnew algorithms or models. Data science,   on the other hand, has a broader scope that can \ninvolve complex machine learning algorithms, often   created from scratch. Data science focuses \non phases from data collection to predictive   modeling. Data analysis, on the other hand, is \nmore about answering specific questions with   that data. And if you've done both your \ndata science and data analytics right,   you'll always be able to keep cantaloupes \nand just about everything else in stock."

                    "transcript": "The data engineer is one of the highest paying data roles with relatively low\ncompetition and a great future. But what does the data engineer\nactually do? The simple answer is that they designed,\nbuild and maintain the infrastructure for collecting,\nstoring and analyzing data, ensuring it's accessible,\nreliable and optimized for performance. But this is a very broad explanation. So let's get into the details of what\nindeed engineer would do day to day, the responsibilities you may have,\nthe exact skills you need, how much data engineers make and finally, I'll compare\nthe data engineer to other data roles, because that is going to give you\na complete understanding of this role. When you understand how a data engineer\ninteracts with other data roles in a team. Let's get started. The engineer might start today\nby monitoring and checking the health and operating of different data\npipelines and databases, because it's going to be up to them\nto ensure that things run smoothly. The data fuels other business functions,\nsuch as the work of a data analyst or a data scientist. So it's important that everything works. Next, they may optimize the performance\nof the databases and data processing tasks because dealing with large data\nsets take a lot of time and power. So we want to make things efficient. Now, when it comes to more specific tasks, the engineer is responsible for developing\nand maintaining ETL processes. ETL stands for Extract Transform Load,\nand it's basically about getting the right data from various sources\ninto the right places where we need it. For example, our own database. Next, a data engineer might do some data\ncleansing because through all of this we need to make sure that the data we have is of high quality\nand that it doesn't contain any problems. Of course, you also want the data in the right format\nduring the day or during the week. A data engineer will also collaborate\nmultiple times with other team members and stakeholders like data scientists,\nanalysts and other clients. For example, it can be requesting access\nto the right data or just making sure\nwe're meeting all the expectations. Of course,\na data engineer will do more things. They may create documentation, security\nmeasures and explore ways to upgrade the existing systems for increased\nefficiency and better capabilities. But these are some of the core\nresponsibilities of a data engineer. Today, let's talk about the salary\nyou can expect as a data engineer, and then we'll talk\nmore about the in-depth skills and compared the data engineer\nto the other data roles in the US. When you start off as a data engineer,\nyou're going to make roughly 100,000. It's going to depend a lot on your state,\nthe company and so on. But we can see that\naccording to Glassdoor, the range is about 83 to 130000. For a data engineer. For a senior data engineer,\nthe average salary is around 136,000 per year, of course, with a large range,\ndepending on different factors. And for you lead engineer, we're looking\nat around an average of 153,000 per year. Even if you're not located in the US,\nI think it should still give you a general understanding of the salary level\nand the data engineer. It paid it very well. Now let's quickly cover the skills\nto become a data engineer. This is according to indeed\npopular employment websites. First we have the coding skills. He did engineer will have solid programing skills with Python\nbeing really important for data engineers. They can also use a variety\nof other programing languages depending on the situation\nto accomplish tasks. So you do need to have strong programing\nfundamentals. Next, you'll want to be familiar with\ndatabase systems and database management. To do this, you will need to know sequel,\nwhich is a key skill, knowledge of diverse database solutions\nand an understanding of data. Warehousing is also essential. Now to work with big data. As a data engineer, you will need\nto understand the relevant tools. For example, Apache Spark Cloud is also\nvery important in today's landscape as a data engineer, where Microsoft Azure,\na US and Google Cloud platform and so on are really important skills\nand these are the most popular as well. Now I do want to emphasize\nthat you don't need to learn them all, but rather look at what companies\nyou want to work at and what they use. If you don't know this,\nthat's completely fine. And I think that's normal. US and Microsoft,\nthese are some of the most popular. It is also necessary to have a strong\nunderstanding of data analysis in itself. But in general, landing a data engineering role is not going to be the easiest thing because your work is really critical\nand can cause a lot of damage. It's done incorrectly. So you could run the data\npipeline or whatever, and therefore you often need\nsome data experience before you become a data engineer. I could mention a lot of more things, but I feel like there's no need\nin repeating myself. The data engineer is going to do\na lot of different things. I could talk for days,\nbut these are really the key skills. It's still unclear. Here is a job\nlisting from a major tech company where you can see\nwhat they actually desire yourself. Now we're going to compare it\nto some other data roles. And when comparing the data engineer\nto other data roles, it is clear that your focus more\non the architecture itself of the data and you're kind of building the foundation\nfor the data in the company. This data may then be used by other team\nmembers for analysis, for machine learning or whatever. You're not really going to work in the spotlight,\nbut your work is really important. Now, the data engineer is\njust one of many amazing data rules. And to learn more about other data\nrules as well, check out this video next. And have an amazing week, guys."

                    "transcript": "python is an open source programming language commonly used in data science as is are which one should you be using at this point you might be expecting a fence sitting well it depends kind of answer but no i'm going to tell you exactly which one to pick right now so here goes i ask you a question and based on your answer you'll know which language to go for ready okay so do you have much in the way of programming experience none use r sum go for python lots r again i'll i'll explain okay question two do you care about awesome looking visualizations and graphics if yes go with r what about the problem you're trying to solve machine learning stuff go with python statistical learning r is your best bet and finally what do most of your colleagues use use that glad to get that off of my chest now we could all just finish here and go about our day but i'd like to explain a little bit more about what these two languages are and how they're best put to use because increasingly the question isn't which to choose but how to make the best use of both programming languages for your specific use cases so let's start with the slightly older of the two which is python now python was released in 1989 and it's a general purpose object-oriented programming language that emphasizes code readability through its oh-so-generous use of white space and it's super popular just behind java and c in popularity in fact there are some awesome libraries that support data science tasks so for example we have numpty it's actually num pi num t that's british slang for an idiot num t and numpty is used for large dimensional arrays and then for data manipulation we have pandas there are also specialized tools for deep learning so you can use things like tensorflow and you'll often find yourself working with python in jupyter notebooks as your ide now let's compare that to r which is optimized for statistical analysis and data visualization so it was developed just a little later in 1992 and it has a rich ecosystem with complex data models and elegant tools for data reporting there are thousands of packages available via the comprehensive r archive network otherwise known as cran and these things are for deep analytical tasks now r provides a broad variety of libraries and tools for things like cleansing data creating visualizations and training deep learning algorithms and r is commonly used with our studio which is an integrated development environment for simplified statistical analysis visualization and reporting so both r and python are open source and are supported by large communities continuously extending their libraries and tools really the biggest differentiator is how they are used and r as i've mentioned is mainly used for statistical analysis while python provides a more general approach to data wrangling you might use r for customer behavior analysis and then you might use python to build a facial recognition application now right up front i said if you have no programming experience or quite a lot of programming experience r was the better bet if you fall somewhere in between then python is easier to pick up but how can how can that be well python is multi-purpose it's considered a multi-purpose language much like c plus and java are and it has a readable syntax that's easy to learn it's considered a good language for beginner programmers or those with experience in similar languages now r on the other hand is built by statisticians and leans heavily into statistical models and specialized specialized analytics now novices can be running data analysis tasks within minutes with just a few lines of code using r but the complexity of advanced functionality in r makes it more difficult to develop expertise now a few other considerations to keep in mind and they all relate specifically to data now when it comes to data collection so actually gathering the data in the first place python supports all kinds of data formats from comma separated value files or csv files to jyson source from the web in contrast r is designed for data analysts to import to data from things like excel and text files now for data exploration then you can use the pandas library to filter sort and display data in a matter of seconds if you use python and r on the other hand is optimized for statistical analysis so you can build probability distributions or apply different statistical models and then finally data modeling has some differences too python has libraries for data modeling like numpty in r you'll sometimes have to rely on packages outside of r's core functionality did i see finally there's one more and that's visualization and with visualization r has the clear edge with a base graphics module allowing you to easily create basic charts and plots and you can use ggplot2 for more advanced plots such as complex scatter plots with regression lines r and python have their strengths but in truth most organizations use a combination of both languages you might conduct early stage data analysis and exploration in r and then switch to python when it's time to ship some data products so which should you use both you're probably going to use a bit of both and if you want to see more videos like this in the future please like and subscribe thanks for watching"

Python and R for data science is a channel\nthat is focused on use of python and R programming languages for data science. In this channel, we will assume our viewers\nhave little to no experience with both programming languages and data science field and therefore,\nwe shall learn from beginner levels and advance our skills and expertise with time. This presentation will introduce the channel,\nhighlight its objectives, give a brief account of the idea for the channel and elaborate\non user expectations and target audience! All other subsequent presentations will be\nbuilt on this concept. As we commence this noble course, we would\nlove to hear how we can make the journey an exotic adventure for you! Please share your views and opinions with\nus by commenting below on this video or drop us a message on email address or twitter handles\nshown on the screen. I’m your presenter Jason Kinyua! Let’s get started! To begin with, what is PyR4DS? PyR4DS is a co-produced and open channel that\nis focused on use of python and R programming languages for data science. It is co-produced to mean it’s not my brain\nchild idea. The idea for the channel was realized from\na chat with peers and friends! The channel is open to mean anyone willing\nto share their knowledge and experience in use of Python and R for Data Science is welcome\nto contribute into the channel! The idea for the channel was conceived one\nafternoon during a lunch hour break in a forest near my workplace. Along the way in the forest, we were chatting\nabout our normal duties and tasks in office. At some point, the conversation changed direction\nto personal engagements and interactions with developer friends and community. The chat got interesting when the course was\non “self-taught developers”. Here I will briefly note important aspects\nof the conversation that led to realization of this channel idea. The developer community may be divided into\ntwo groups depending on path taken during learning phases. The first category of developer is comprised\nof developers who went to school to learn software development. The other category is made up of developers\nwho learnt programming using articles, blogs, youtube and other community resources. This second group had to follow a painful\nsteep learning curve, and for this reason, they are justified to call themselves “self-taught\ndevelopers”. However, on this day I got another perception,\ntake it this way.... Assume the articles, blogs, video channels\nand other community resources that these ‘self-taught’ developers used to learn were out of their\nreach! these guys would never have a way of learning software development and thus would\nnever have become developers - let alone being self-taught developers. This is why I feel it safe calling them community-taught\ndevelopers. Looking at this new perspective considering\nboth groups, collectively all developers are community-taught in one way or the other - that\nis regardless of the initial path taken to learn programming. This is because almost all developers from\ntime to time use documentations and other community resources to learn and adopt new\ntools. And this is the major source of inspiration\nfor this channel: to share knowledge and contribute to the data science community. The community has built us and it is time\nto give back! Anyone passionate and willing to contribute\ninto the channel is welcome provided they adhere to channel regulations. Coming back to this slide content, in this\nchannel: we shall cover Python and R basics\ncover dashboard development using python and R (that is django for python and shiny for\nR) build and use APIs. (here we will cover both\nRESTful and GraphQL APIs. To develop RESTful API, we will use Django\nRest Framework, Flask and FastAPI for python and plumber for R. To develop GraphQL API,\nwe shall use Django Graphene and cover both Python and R graphql clients)\nafter developing dashboards and APIs, we shall look into their deployment. Here we shall look at alternative ways of\ndeploying our dashboards including shipping with docker and hosting on shinyproxy. We will frequently use git for code versioning,\n‘green unicorn’ to expose services to clients and nginx as a client facing server\n(that is a web-server). Later we may look at other alternatives like\nsupervisord, apache2, HA proxy and traefik. This being the first time I’m presenting\non this channel, I think it is fair to introduce myself. I’m a graduate from Dedan Kimathi University\nof Technology. While in campus, I actively participated in\nvarious code sprint and hackathon events. Some time I would represent our department\nduring national events, for instance, in the photo above is me shaking hands with the president\nof republic of Kenya, the year 2017 during an agricultural and technology exhibition. While still in campus, I worked with Nyeri\nWater and Sewerage Company as an intern and Kenya International Boundaries Office as a\nGIS analyst. Later after graduation I worked for Celestial\nGeoconsultants Ltd where I was the developer team lead during development of CETRAD-EWS\nsystem. While still at Celestial, I developed a data\naggregation module for The Nature Conservancy under Nairobi Fund. Currently I’m working for CIFOR-ICRAF where\nI’m responsible for data management, analysis, reporting and dashboard development to support\ndata-driven decision-making process. At my workplace, I combine conventional data\nand spatial data into a data science pipeline to produce decision making tools. As I earlier mentioned, this channel is not\nmy brain child idea. The channel idea was realized from a discussion\nwith Muhammad. Muhammad is a very good friend of mine, my\nsenior and coach at workplace. You will have an opportunity to know him better\nin forthcoming videos. So, what should you expect from this channel! In this channel, we shall be exploring data\nscience project workflow, starting with data, heed to analysis of the data, report generation,\nwrapping the reports into neat dashboards, sharing the dashboards with stakeholders and\nusers and finally close with tips of how to monitor the dashboard and maintain associated\nsystems. In particular, we shall start by introducing\nthe two fundamental programming languages that we shall be using during the course of\nthis channel. Later we shall look into data component with\nan aim of understanding data types, data formats and commonly used DataBase Management Systems. It is at this point that we shall get to know\nwhat to consider when choosing a data storage engine. Under data analysis and processing, we shall\nperform basic Exploratory Data Analysis and write algorithms that transform our dataset\nto generate summary statistics. Before closing on this, we will explore a\nnumber of open source packages that will make data analysis and processing easier! Next we will explore various ways that we\ncan visualize our data, how to interpret the graphics and generate insights. Finally, we will knit our work into an aesthetically\nappealing and easy to navigate dashboard. We will also look into how the dashboard is\ndeployed, monitored, enhanced with feature updates/improvements and maintenance of the\nhost server! As you might have guessed, this is a lot of\nwork that will take a couple of months to completely cover. Also, given the work at hand in office, we\nmay not be able to upload regularly. However, we will be consistent and ensure\nwe stream at least once in two weeks. Please be patient with us! Last but not the least, who is this channel\nfor? This channel was inspired by drastically increasing\ndemand for data scientists which has led to high number of aspiring data scientists who\ndon’t know where to start. correspondingly, big data from IoT devices,\nrapid field activities and massive secondary data available overtime has pressurized practicing\ndata scientists to upgrade their skills to match market demand for automated, portable,\nscalable, flexible and extensible data processing and reporting. This channel is targeting to assist these\nfour group of users: First: Aspiring Data Scientists in need of\ncareer guidance. Secondly: Data science practitioners who want\nto migrate from data science tools they use to python or R.\nThirdly: Data scientists who want to advance their data analysis and reporting skills using\nPython or R. And Finally: Scientists and system engineers\nconcerned in any area that has been highlighted in the “What to expect” slide. That is it for today folks! Thank you very much!"
