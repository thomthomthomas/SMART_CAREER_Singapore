are those differences and deep learning is another one that comes into play I actually did a video on these three artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning and talked about where they fit and there were a lot of comments on that and I read those comments and I'd like to address some of the most frequently asked questions so that we clear up some of the myths and misconceptions around this in addition something else has happened since that video was recorded and that is this the absolute explosion of this area of generative AI things like large language models and chat Bots have seemed to be taking over the world we see them everywhere really interesting technology uh and then also things like deep fakes these are all within the realm of AI but how do they fit within each other how are they related to each other we're going to take a look at that in this video and try to explain how all these Technologies relate and how we can use them first off a little bit of a disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify some of these Concepts in order to not make this video last for a week so those of you that are really deep experts in the field apologies in advance but we're going to try to make this simple and and that will involve some generalizations first of all let's start with AI artificial intelligence is basically trying to simulate with a computer something that would match or exceed human intelligence what is intelligence well it could be a lot of different things but generally we tend to think of it as the ability to learn to infer and to reason things like that so that's what we're trying to do in the broad field of AI of artificial intelligence and if we look at a timeline of AI it really kind of started back around on this time frame and in those days it was very premature most people had not even heard of it uh and uh it basically was a research project but I can tell you uh as an undergrad which for me was back during these times uh we were doing AI work in fact we would use programming languages like lisp uh or prologue uh and these kinds of things uh were kind of the predecessors to what became later expert systems and this was a technology again some of these things existed previous but that's when it really uh hit kind of a critical mass and became more popularized so expert systems of the 1980s maybe in the 90s and and again we use Technologies like this all of this uh was was something that we did before we ever touched in to the next topic I'm going to talk about and that's the area of machine learning machine learning is as its name implies the machine is learning I don't have to program it I give it lots of information and and it observes things so for instance if I start doing this if I give you this and then ask you to predict what's the next thing that's going to be there well you might get it you might not you have very limited training data to base this on but if I gave you one of those and then ask you what to predict would happen next well you're probably going to say this and then you're going to say it's this and then you think you got it all figured out and then you see one of these and then all of a sudden I give you one of those and throw you a curveball so this in fact and then maybe it it goes on like this so a machine learning algorithm is really good at looking at patterns and discovering patterns within data the more training data you can give it the more confident it can be in predicting so predictions are one of the things that machine learning is is particularly good at another thing is spotting outliers like this and saying oh that doesn't belong in it looks different than all the other stuff because the sequence was broken so that's particularly useful in cyber security the area that I work in because we're looking for outliers we're looking for users who are using the system in ways that they shouldn't be or ways that they don't typically do so this technology machine learning is particularly useful for us and machine learning really came along uh and became more popularized uh in this time frame uh in the the 2010s uh and again uh back when I was an undergrad riding my dinosaur to class we were doing this kind of stuff we never once talked about machine learning it might have existed but it really wasn't hadn't hit the popular uh mindset yet uh but this technology has matured greatly over the last few decades and now it becomes the basis of a lot we do going forward the next layer of our Vin diagram involves deep learning well it's deep learning in the sense that with deep learning we use these things called neural networks neural networks are ways that in a computer we simulate and mimic the way the human brain works at least to the extent that we understand how the brain works and it's called Deep because we have multiple layers of those neural networks and the interesting thing about these is they will simulate the way a brain operates but I don't know if you've noticed but human brains can be a little bit unpredictable you put certain things in you don't always get the very same thing out and deep learning is the same way in some cases we're not actually able to fully understand why we get the results we do uh because there are so many layers to the neural network it's a little bit hard to to decompose and figure out exactly what's in there but this has become a very important part and a very important advancement that also reached some popularity during the 2010s and as something that we use still today as the basis for our next area of AI the most recent advancements in the field of artificial in intelligence all really are in this space the area of generative AI now I'm going to introduce a term that you may not be familiar with it's the idea of foundation models Foundation models is where we get some of these kinds of things for instance an example of a foundation model would be a large language model which is where we take language and we model it and we make predictions in this technology where if I see certain types of of words then I can sort of predict what the next set of words will be I'm going to oversimplify here for the sake of Simplicity but think about this as a little bit like the autoc complete when you start typing something in and then it predicts what your next word will be except in this case with large language models they're not predicting the next word they're predicting the next sentence the next paragraph the next entire document so there's a really an amazing exponential leap in what these things are able to do and we call all of these Technologies generative because they are generating new content um some people have actually made the argument that the generative AI isn't really generative that that these Technologies are really just regurgitating existing information and putting it in different format well let me give you an analogy um if you take music for instance then every note has already been invented so in a sense every song is just a recombination some other permutation of all the notes that already exist already and just putting them in a different order well we don't say new new music doesn't exist people are still composing and creating new songs from the existing information I'm going to say geni is similar it's a it's an analogy so there'll be some imperfections in it but you get the general idea actually new content can be generated out of these and there are a lot of different forms that this can take with other types of models are uh Audio models uh video models and things like that well in fact these we can use to create deep fakes and deep fakes are examples where we're able to take for instance a person's voice and recreate that and then have it seem like the person said things they never said well it's really useful in entertainment situations uh in parities and things like that uh or if someone's losing their voice then you could capture their voice and then they'd be able to type and you'd be able to hear it in their voice but there's also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused um the chat Bots again come from this space the Deep fakes come from this space but they're all part of generative Ai and all part of these Foundation models and this again is the area that has really caused all of us to really pay attention to AI the possibilities of generating new content or in some cases summarizing existing content and giving us uh something that is bite-size and manageable this is what has gotten all of the attention this is where the chat Bots and all of these things come in in the early days ai's adoption started off pretty slowly most people didn't even know it existed and if they did it was something that always seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years away but then machine learning deep learning and things like that came along and we started seeing some uptake then Foundation models gen Ai and the light came along and this stuff went straight to the Moon these Foundation models are what have changed the adoption curve and now you see AI being adopted everywhere and the thing for us to understand is where this is where it fits in and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of this technology if you like this video and want to see more like

                    "transcript": "AI is changing extremely fast in 2025 and so is the way that you should be learning it. So, in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how I would learn AI and ML if I was starting completely from scratch with all of the knowledge that I have today. Let's get into it. Now, the first thing or step zero on my list would be to make sure that I was thinking like an engineer. Now look, there's a long list of topics that I'm going to share with you here. All things that are important to learn. But none of them matter if you don't build that deep critical thinking skill. The things that separate good software engineers from great software engineers are the ability to break down problems and to think critically. So as you listen to this list, keep in mind that it's not about memorizing concepts. It's about truly understanding what's going on and being able to solve abstract complex problems, which is really where humans come in and where we're not yet being replaced by AI models. Anyways with step zero out of the way, the first thing that I would be focusing on is really diving deep into Python. Now look, obviously there's all kinds of no code tools out there, but if you want to be an effective AI or ML engineer, I do believe that you still do need to know how to code. And the best way to do that is to start with Python. Python is just the easiest language to learn. It's the best for AI and ML. And personally, if I was diving into this, I would be focusing on learning the fundamentals skipping all of the advanced theory, and building automation projects as quickly as possible. That's what Python is really good at, automating tasks, doing things like data science. So, I would start with things like scripting or scraping. So, web scraping for example. Then I would get into things like numpy mapplot, lib, and pandas. and just get really competent working with data sets within Python. I would also focus on learning the basics of APIs. So, how to make a very simple one and how to call APIs from Python. I'd be doing all of this with the goal of building projects as quickly as possible, not getting into the weeds of all of the theoretical concepts and really just getting comfortable writing code in Python so I can use this as a tool later on when I dive more into the advanced AI and ML stuff. So, that's step one. get comfortable with Python and do it in a practical way using a lot of the tools that I just mentioned. That's personally what I would be doing. And by the way guys, what I'm sharing with you here is not necessarily what I would do if I was trying to land a job, but it's purely what I would do to get good at this as quickly as possible. Now, with that in mind, if you are trying to land an AI or ML job, something that you're going to struggle with is finding a program that teaches you practical skills, but actually balances that with real world credibility. Now, that's why I was quite impressed when I came across SimplyLearn, the sponsor of today's video. Now, this is a world's leading online platform for tech and business education, and they've got a full catalog of hands-on boot camps, and their AI and machine learning programs are seriously well put together. These are live instructor-led classes, not just videos, and they're built in collaboration with some of the world's top universities and companies. The curriculum is projectbased careerfocused, and covers tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Chat GPT depending on the path that you choose. Now, they've got thousands of five-star reviews, recommendations from Switch up Course Support, and Forbes, and tons of success stories from students that have completely changed their career after going through the program. Now, if you're serious about getting into AI or ML, then definitely check out Simply Learns Programs. Click the link in the description or the pinned comment to take your first step towards your next big career move. Now, moving on to step number two, and this one I would try to do fairly quickly, and that's to become data literate. What I mean by this is just being familiar working with data. So, I'd want to learn some basic SQL like some joins, some select statements. What actually is SQL? How do you work with this? I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

exponential leap in what these things are able to do and we call all of these Technologies generative because they are generating new content um some people have actually made the argument that the generative AI isn't really generative that that these Technologies are really just regurgitating existing information and putting it in different format well let me give you an analogy um if you take music for instance then every note has already been invented so in a sense every song is just a recombination some other permutation of all the notes that already exist already and just putting them in a different order well we don't say new new music doesn't exist people are still composing and creating new songs from the existing information I'm going to say geni is similar it's a it's an analogy so there'll be some imperfections in it but you get the general idea actually new content can be generated out of these and there are a lot of different forms that this can take with other types of models are uh Audio models uh video models and things like that well in fact these we can use to create deep fakes and deep fakes are examples where we're able to take for instance a person's voice and recreate that and then have it seem like the person said things they never said well it's really useful in entertainment situations uh in parities and things like that uh or if someone's losing their voice then you could capture their voice and then they'd be able to type and you'd be able to hear it in their voice but there's also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused um the chat Bots again come from this space the Deep fakes come from this space but they're all part of generative Ai and all part of these Foundation models and this again is the area that has really caused all of us to really pay attention to AI the possibilities of generating new content or in some cases summarizing existing content and giving us uh something that is bite-size and manageable this is what has gotten all of the attention this is where the chat Bots and all of these things come in in the early days ai's adoption started off pretty slowly most people didn't even know it existed and if they did it was something that always seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years away but then machine learning deep learning and things like that came along and we started seeing some uptake then Foundation models gen Ai and the light came along and this stuff went straight to the Moon these Foundation models are what have changed the adoption curve and now you see AI being adopted everywhere and the thing for us to understand is where this is where it fits in and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of this technology if you like this video and want to see more like

                    "transcript": "AI is changing extremely fast in 2025 and so is the way that you should be learning it. So, in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how I would learn AI and ML if I was starting completely from scratch with all of the knowledge that I have today. Let's get into it. Now, the first thing or step zero on my list would be to make sure that I was thinking like an engineer. Now look, there's a long list of topics that I'm going to share with you here. All things that are important to learn. But none of them matter if you don't build that deep critical thinking skill. The things that separate good software engineers from great software engineers are the ability to break down problems and to think critically. So as you listen to this list, keep in mind that it's not about memorizing concepts. It's about truly understanding what's going on and being able to solve abstract complex problems, which is really where humans come in and where we're not yet being replaced by AI models. Anyways with step zero out of the way, the first thing that I would be focusing on is really diving deep into Python. Now look, obviously there's all kinds of no code tools out there, but if you want to be an effective AI or ML engineer, I do believe that you still do need to know how to code. And the best way to do that is to start with Python. Python is just the easiest language to learn. It's the best for AI and ML. And personally, if I was diving into this, I would be focusing on learning the fundamentals skipping all of the advanced theory, and building automation projects as quickly as possible. That's what Python is really good at, automating tasks, doing things like data science. So, I would start with things like scripting or scraping. So, web scraping for example. Then I would get into things like numpy mapplot, lib, and pandas. and just get really competent working with data sets within Python. I would also focus on learning the basics of APIs. So, how to make a very simple one and how to call APIs from Python. I'd be doing all of this with the goal of building projects as quickly as possible, not getting into the weeds of all of the theoretical concepts and really just getting comfortable writing code in Python so I can use this as a tool later on when I dive more into the advanced AI and ML stuff. So, that's step one. get comfortable with Python and do it in a practical way using a lot of the tools that I just mentioned. That's personally what I would be doing. And by the way guys, what I'm sharing with you here is not necessarily what I would do if I was trying to land a job, but it's purely what I would do to get good at this as quickly as possible. Now, with that in mind, if you are trying to land an AI or ML job, something that you're going to struggle with is finding a program that teaches you practical skills, but actually balances that with real world credibility. Now, that's why I was quite impressed when I came across SimplyLearn, the sponsor of today's video. Now, this is a world's leading online platform for tech and business education, and they've got a full catalog of hands-on boot camps, and their AI and machine learning programs are seriously well put together. These are live instructor-led classes, not just videos, and they're built in collaboration with some of the world's top universities and companies.

Now, they've got thousands of five-star reviews, recommendations from Switch up Course Support, and Forbes, and tons of success stories from students that have completely changed their career after going through the program. Now, if you're serious about getting into AI or ML, then definitely check out Simply Learns Programs. Click the link in the description or the pinned comment to take your first step towards your next big career move. Now, moving on to step number two, and this one I would try to do fairly quickly, and that's to become data literate. What I mean by this is just being familiar working with data. So, I'd want to learn some basic SQL like some joins, some select statements. What actually is SQL? How do you work with this? I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

                    "transcript": "What is natural language processing? Well, \nyou're doing it right now, you're listening   to the words and the sentences that I'm forming \nand you are forming some sort of comprehension   from it. And when we ask a computer to do that \nthat is NLP, or natural language processing.   My name is Martin Keen, I'm \na Master Inventor at IBM,   and I've utilized NLP in a good number of \nmy invention disclosures. NLP really has a   really high utility value in all sorts of AI \napplications. Now NLP starts with something called   unstructured text. What is that? Well, that's \njust what you and I say, that's how we speak.   So, for example, some unstructured text is \n\"add eggs and milk to my shopping list.\"   Now you and I understand exactly what that means, \nbut it is unstructured at least to a computer. So what we need to do, is to have a structured \nrepresentation of that same information that   a computer can process. Now that might look \nsomething a bit more like this where we have a   shopping list element. And then it has sub \nelements within it like an item for eggs, and an item for milk. That is an example of \nsomething that is structured. Now the job of natural language processing \nis to translate between these two things.   So NLP sits right in the middle here translating \nbetween unstructured and structured data. And when   we go from structure from unstructured here \nto structured this way, that's called NLU, or   natural language understanding. And when we \ngo this way from structured to unstructured,   that's called natural language generation, \nor NLG. We're going to focus today primarily   on going from unstructured to structured in \nnatural language processing now let's think of   some use cases where nlp might be quite handy. \nFirst of all, we've got machine translation. Now when we translate from one language to \nanother we need to understand the context of   that sentence. It's not just a case of taking \neach individual word from say English and   then translating it into another language. We \nneed to understand the overall structure   and context of what's being said. And my \nfavorite example of this going horribly wrong   is if you take the phrase the \"spirit is willing, \nbut the flesh is weak\" and you translate that from   English to Russian and then you translate \nthat Russian translation back into English   you're going to go from the \"spirit is willing, \nbut the flesh is weak\" to something a bit more   like the \"vodka is good, but the meat is \nrotten\" which is really not the intended   context of that sentence whatsoever. So \nNLP can help with situations like that. Now   the the second kind of use case that I like \nto mention relates to virtual assistants,   and also to things like chatbots. Now a virtual \nassistant that's something like Siri, or Alexa   on your phone that is taking human utterances and \nderiving a command to execute based upon that. And   a chatbot is something similar except in written \nlanguage and that's taking written language and   then using it to traverse a decision tree in order \nto take an action. NLP is very helpful there.   Another use case is for sentiment analysis. Now \nthis is taking some text perhaps an email message   or a product review and trying to derive \nthe sentiment that's expressed within it.   So for example, is this product review a positive \nsentiment or a negative sentiment, is it written   as a serious statement or is it being sarcastic? \nWe can use NLP to tell us. And then finally,   another good example is spam detection so this \nis a case of looking at a given email message   and trying to drive is this a real email \nmessage or is it spam and we can look for   pointers within the content of the message. So \nthings like overused words or poor grammar or an   inappropriate claim of urgency can all indicate \nthat this is actually perhaps spam. So those are   some of the things that NLP can provide but how \ndoes it work well the thing with NLP is it's not like one algorithm, it's actually more like a \nbag of tools and you can apply these bag of tools   to be able to resolve some of these use cases. \nNow the input to NLP is some unstructured text   so either some written text or spoken text that \nhas been converted to written text through a   speech to text algorithm. Once we've got that, \nthe first stage of NLP is called tokenization This is about taking a string and breaking \nit down into chunks so if we consider the   unstructured text we've got here \"add \neggs and milk to my shopping list\"   that's eight words that can be eight tokens.   And from here on in we are going to work one \ntoken at a time as we traverse through this. Now   the first stage once we've got things down into \ntokens that we can perform is called stemming. And this is all about deriving the word stem \nfor a given token. So for example, running,   runs, and ran, the word stem for all three of \nthose is run. We're just kind of removing the   prefix and the suffixes and normalizing the \ntense and we're getting to the word stem.   But stemming doesn't work well for every \ntoken. For example, universal and university,   well they don't really stem down to \nuniverse. For situations like that,   there is another tool that we have \navailable and that is called lemmatization.   And lemmatization takes a given token and learns \nits meaning through a dictionary definition   and from there it can derive its root, or its lem. \nSo take better for example, better is derived from   good so the root, or the lem, of better is good. \nThe stem of better would be bet. So you can see   that it is significant whether we use stemming, \nor we use lemmatization for a given token.   Now next thing we can do is we can do a \nprocess called part of speech tagging. And what this is doing is for a given token \nit's looking where that token is used within the   context of a sentence. So take the word make for \nexample, if I say \"I'm going to make dinner\", make   is a verb. But if I ask you \"what make is your \nlaptop?\", well make is now a noun. So where that   token is used in the sentence matters, part of \nspeech tagging can help us derive that context.   And then finally, another stage \nis named entity recognition.   And what this is asking is for a given token \nis there an entity associated with it. So   for example, a token of Arizona has an entity of a \nU.S. state whereas a token of Ralph has an entity   of a person's name. And these are some of the \ntools that we can apply in this big bag of tools   that we have for NLP in order to get from this \nunstructured human speech through to something   structured that a computer can understand. And \nonce we've done that then we can apply that   structured data to all sorts of AI applications. \nNow there's obviously a lot more to it than this   and I've included some links in the description if \nyou'd like to know more, but hopefully this made   some sense and that you were able to process some \nof the natural language that I've shared today.   Thanks for watching. If you have questions, \nplease drop us a line below. And if you want   to see more videos like this in the \nfuture, please like and subscribe."

I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

the skills you should   learn to become a computer vision engineer and all the different ways \nin which you can specialize in computer vision and I'm also giving you very specific resources \nyou can use in order to learn all the skills  I show you in this roadmap and now let's get started so let's get started with \nthis computer vision roadmap, in this video I'm going to show you an entire roadmap in \norder to go from zero from scratch from having   absolutely no background in IT whatsoever up to a \ncomplete expert computer visual engineer so let's   get started the first step you should follow \nin this roadmap is covering the fundamentals   and when I say fundamentals I mean Python and \nopencv these two skills are definitely the most   important skills you should start with in order to \nbecome a computer vision engineer, and this video,   this computer vision roadmap is an updated version \nof one of my previous videos, and in this version   I have added some specific resources you can take \nyou can follow in order to learn all the different   skills I am going to show you in this roadmap so \nin order to Learn Python and in order to learn OpenCV   you can take a look at these two resources I have \nadded over here and regarding opencv this is a   three hours long fully comprehensive course of \nopencv with python and I definitely recommend   you to check out this course but if you do not \nhave three hours in order to take this course   then these are the most important lessons you \nshould take in order to cover the basics of   opencv with python so if you do have three hours \nthen please take a... take a look at this course but   if you do not don't worry you can just take some \nof these lessons and you are going to cover the   most important aspects of opencv with python so \nthis is the first step you should take in order to   learn computer vision, in order to become a computer \nvision engineer and now let's continue the next   step in this roadmap is the basics of machine \nlearning, machine learning is very very very   important in computer vision and these are the \nmost important things you should learn, these are   the four most important tasks in computer vision \nimage classification object detection semantic   segmentation and pose detection and this is the \nway I recommend you to learn machine learning by   learning how to solve these four very specific \nproblems, these four very specific tasks, so by   learning how to build an image classifier how to \nbuild an object detector how to build a semantic   segmentation algorithm and how to build a pose \ndetector oh my God you will have learned so much   machine learning and you will be super super \nproficient in machine learning these are the   most important machine learning tasks in computer \nvision and these are some very specific resources   you could use in order to learn how to solve \nthese problems right these are some courses   and some tutorials I recommend you in order to \nsolve these problems in order to learn how to   solve these problems and by doing so by solving \nthese problems you are going to learn how to use   some very specific tools which are... let me show you \nscikit learn yolo V8 yolo nas pytorch tensorflow   and many many many more tools and please pay \nattention because this is very very very important   these are the tools we use in order to solve these \nproblems right but the important thing is not the   tools we use the important thing is the problems \nwe are solving by using the tools right so my   recommendation for you is do not focus on learning \nhow to use the very specific tools but focus on   how you are going to solve each one of these \nproblems and by doing so you are going to learn   how to use different tools right my recommendation \nfor you is do not focus on learning the tools   focus on learning how to solve these very specific \nproblems but if you are one of those people who   prefer to learn the tools that's perfectly fine \nI have also added some resources for you right   because I know we all have different preferences \nso if you prefer to learn how to use the   tools these are some resources you could use right \nbut remember my recommendation is do not focus on   the tools focus on how you're going to solve \nthe high level problems image classification   object detection semantic segmentation and pose \ndetection which are perhaps the most important   machine learning problems in computer vision now \nlet's continue and you can see that from here from   basic machine learning you can take it in either \none of these two paths let's take it over here for   now and later on I'm going to show you what's \nover here so following this path we have the   specialization right now that you feel confident \nin Python and opencv, now that you have learned   the basics of machine learning now it's time to \nspecialize right and you have many different ways   to specialize one of these different ways is low \nlevel programming and electronics which basically   involves C++ and how to work with an \nedge device for example Arduino or jetson nano   and the reason this is one of the ways in which \nyou can specialize in computer vision is because   although C++ is a very very very important \nprogramming language you can definitely take up   many projects as a computer vision engineer \nand you can just become a computer vision   engineer without really doing anything related \nto low level programming or anything related to   electronics right it's perfectly possible so this \nis one of the ways in which you can specialize if   you want to go deep into low level programming if \nyou want to go deep into working with electronics   working with robotics for example then you can \njust specialize and you can do it learning C++   and learning how to work with this type of \nedge devices now another way in which you can   specialize is by taking the research path \nright, by doing research and this   involves learning very advanced machine learning \nand also very advanced mathematics there's a huge   misconception in computer vision which is that you \ndefinitely need very advanced mathematics and you   differently need to know how to work with very \nAdvanced mathematical objects and operations in   order to do computer vision and that is not true \nthat's a misconception that is false I can tell   you that you can definitely work in the field as \na computer vision engineer and you can definitely   take many many projects and you can definitely \nmake a lot of money as a computer visual engineer   by knowing Python opencv and the basics of machine \nlearning only by knowing these skills you will be   able to solve the machine learning part of many \nmany projects and you will be able to solve many   projects. Knowing the advanced mathematics and \nthe advanced machine learning and the advanced   everything is not absolutely needed that's why this \nis... I consider this is one of the ways in which you   can specialize right and if you want to take this \nroute these are some very specific resources you   could take right and I forgot to mention these \nare some very specific resources you can follow   in order to learn this other way to specialize in \ncomputer vision which is low level programming and   electronics but let's continue now let's take \nit to the other way which you can specialize   which is generative Ai and this basically involves \nimage generation and also text generation right this is   something that I would say it's huge already \nit's already a very very important field in   computer vision and my thoughts are that in the \nnext few years this is going to be bigger and   bigger this is going to be a very very important \nfield in computer vision and these are some very   specific tutorials from my own YouTube channel \nyou can take in order to learn how to work with   image generation and text generation in a computer \nvision project now let's continue these are   some of the ways in which you can specialize \nin computer vision these are definitely not   all the ways in which you can specialize there \ncould be other ways but I think these are some   of the most important paths you could take as \na computer vision engineer but now let's take   it back remember that from basic machine \nlearning we could take another path right let's   see what's over here and this is where we have \nall the software related skills right because   remember as a computer vision engineer you are \nnot working on a vacuum right you are working   with other software developers you are building \nproducts you are doing some things which involve   software so the more you know about software \nthe more software related skills you may have   is going to be much much more better for you \nand these are some very specific examples of   some very specific software skills which are very \nimportant in computer vision as a computer vision   engineer you definitely need to know how to work \nwith a Version Control software for example GitHub   you'll definitely need to know how to work with \nDocker is going to be a plus for sure in your   career if you know how to work with Docker it's \nvery important you know how to work with a cloud   provider with a cloud development platform for \nexample AWS Google cloud or Azure and it's also   a plus it's something very important if you are \nfamiliar with web development technologies let me   tell you a very quick story about me about myself \nwhen I was just starting in computer vision I   completely underestimated how important it is all \nthese software related skills and I thought that   by learning Python opencv and the Very basics \nof machine learning the very Basics by learning   how to build an image classifier, the very basics \nof machine learning I was all set I was ready to   work in the top companies in the field to work \nin Google in Tesla in SpaceX... I thought I   was ready, that was all, that was it, and I was \nwrong I was so so super wrong for many different   reasons and one of them is because I completely \nunderestimated all these software related skills   if you are going to work in computer vision \nyou'll definitely need to know something other   than computer vision and this is very important \nbecause this is very often underestimated by many   people in the computer vision industry or in \nthe machine learning industry there are many   people who believe who think that by learning \nthe basics of machine learning that's it   that's not all if you're going to work in the \nfield or you need to know something other than   computer vision and these are some very specific \nresources you could take in order to learn all   these skills and also remember that working in a \ncompany as an employee it's only one of the many   many different career choices you can take in your \nprofessional career you could also be something   like a freelancer, a freelance computer vision \nengineer, and if you decide to be a freelancer   and a client hires you to do something like \nbuilding a machine learning model, building   an object detector and serving this model through \nan API and you tell the client 'okay I can help   you building the model but in order to serve it \nthrough the API hire someone else because I don't   even know what's an API' the client is going to \nsay something like 'oh okay okay I am going to   hire someone else, I'm going to hire someone else \nto do the entire project is going to be much more   affordable it's going to be much more easier to \nmanage than if I hire many different developers   to make each one of the tasks in this project' so \nthis is especially the case if you decide to be   something like a freelancer because the moment \nyou tell your client you don't know how to do   something the moment this client replaces you by \nsomeone else so this is very important if you want   to be a freelancer as well now let's continue \nI have already show you the entire roadmap you   should take in order to become a computer vision \nengineer with very specific resources and I have   also shown you all the different ways in which \nyou can specialize as a computer visual engineer   now let's continue because now it's time to \nshow you how to enhance your skillset, how to   grow your skills and one of the ways in which you \ncan grow your skills as a computer vision engineer   is by working on projects by making projects by \ndoing projects by hands-on experience working   on projects and there are two different ways in \nwhich you can do that one of them is by following   coding tutorials and projects in YouTube, \nand there are many many projects you can take you   can do on YouTube these are only a few examples \nof some of my tutorials of my projects in this   YouTube channel and you can also take many paid \ncourses right if you want to take your skills a   step further if you really want to become like \nan absolute expert then you also have many paid   resources you could use in order to enhance your \nskillset even further right and these are only   a few examples also from my own paid products for \nexample this is a project which is available in my   Patreon and in this project I show you the entire \nprocess of how to build a video summarization API   I take you from the requirements up to the project \ndeliverable and I show you every single step of   this process how to do the planning how to do the \nsystem design how to work in the execution every   single step of this process and this is exactly \nhow a real world computer vision project looks like, then this is another example this is also \navailable my Patreon and this is a very Advanced lesson   on how to train a machine learning model and it \ninvolves how to control the randomness when you   are training a machine learning model this is \na very very Advanced lesson and these are a few   resources you will take in order to enhance your \nskillset as a computer vision engineer and then   you also have other resources and in these other \nresources are for example books you could read   books on computer vision in order to improve \nyour skill set as a computer vision engineer   these are only a few examples of some of the books \nyou could read in order to become a super absolute   expert computer vision engineer then another very \ninteresting resource is joining a community and   these are some examples this Discord server is \nthis YouTube channel Discord server right this is   our community and this is a very very interesting \nresource the way usually work is that the members   of our community post the projects in which \nthey are currently working in and everyone else   recommend this user different things he or she can \ndo with his or her project we say something like   hey have you tried to do this have you tried to \ndo the other thing have you tried to do this with   the data I don't know we collaborate in many \ndifferent ways so we help everyone with their   computer vision projects this is a very very very \ninteresting resource in order to go deeper into   your knowledge of computer vision then these \nare some subreddits you could consider, computer   vision, machine learning, these are some super \nhigh levels subreddits but you also have   many other subreddits which are very very valuable \nin order to learn more about a very very specific   niche for example this one about stable diffusion \nI have used this subreddit a lot lately because I   have been learning a lot about stable diffusion and \nthis subreddit is perhaps one of the most valuable   resources in order to learn stable diffusion \nso these are only a few examples of some of the   communities and some of the subreddits you could \nuse and then another very interesting resource in   order to go deeper into your computer vision \nknowledge is joining a competition, competing   with other people that's oh my God that's going \nto take your skill set a step further for sure in   order to do so I recommend you to use kaggle \nwhich is perhaps the most important and the   most relevant site in order to do competitive \ncomputer vision in order to join a competition   in which you have to train a computer vision \nmodel and compete against other competitors so   this is going to be all for this computer vision \nroadmap please let me know what you think in the

                    "transcript": "AI is changing extremely fast in 2025 and so is the way that you should be learning it. So, in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how I would learn AI and ML if I was starting completely from scratch with all of the knowledge that I have today. Let's get into it. Now, the first thing or step zero on my list would be to make sure that I was thinking like an engineer. Now look, there's a long list of topics that I'm going to share with you here. All things that are important to learn. But none of them matter if you don't build that deep critical thinking skill. The things that separate good software engineers from great software engineers are the ability to break down problems and to think critically. So as you listen to this list, keep in mind that it's not about memorizing concepts. It's about truly understanding what's going on and being able to solve abstract complex problems, which is really where humans come in and where we're not yet being replaced by AI models. Anyways with step zero out of the way, the first thing that I would be focusing on is really diving deep into Python. Now look, obviously there's all kinds of no code tools out there, but if you want to be an effective AI or ML engineer, I do believe that you still do need to know how to code. And the best way to do that is to start with Python. Python is just the easiest language to learn. It's the best for AI and ML. And personally, if I was diving into this, I would be focusing on learning the fundamentals skipping all of the advanced theory, and building automation projects as quickly as possible. That's what Python is really good at, automating tasks, doing things like data science. So, I would start with things like scripting or scraping. So, web scraping for example. Then I would get into things like numpy mapplot, lib, and pandas. and just get really competent working with data sets within Python. I would also focus on learning the basics of APIs. So, how to make a very simple one and how to call APIs from Python. I'd be doing all of this with the goal of building projects as quickly as possible, not getting into the weeds of all of the theoretical concepts and really just getting comfortable writing code in Python so I can use this as a tool later on when I dive more into the advanced AI and ML stuff. So, that's step one. get comfortable with Python and do it in a practical way using a lot of the tools that I just mentioned. That's personally what I would be doing. And by the way guys, what I'm sharing with you here is not necessarily what I would do if I was trying to land a job, but it's purely what I would do to get good at this as quickly as possible. Now, with that in mind, if you are trying to land an AI or ML job, something that you're going to struggle with is finding a program that teaches you practical skills, but actually balances that with real world credibility. Now, that's why I was quite impressed when I came across SimplyLearn, the sponsor of today's video. Now, this is a world's leading online platform for tech and business education, and they've got a full catalog of hands-on boot camps, and their AI and machine learning programs are seriously well put together. These are live instructor-led classes, not just videos, and they're built in collaboration with some of the world's top universities and companies. The curriculum is projectbased careerfocused, and covers tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Chat GPT depending on the path that you choose. Now, they've got thousands of five-star reviews, recommendations from Switch up Course Support, and Forbes, and tons of success stories from students that have completely changed their career after going through the program. Now, if you're serious about getting into AI or ML, then definitely check out Simply Learns Programs. Click the link in the description or the pinned comment to take your first step towards your next big career move. Now, moving on to step number two, and this one I would try to do fairly quickly, and that's to become data literate. What I mean by this is just being familiar working with data. So, I'd want to learn some basic SQL like some joins, some select statements. What actually is SQL? How do you work with this? I would dive much more into something like pandas, learn it with some more advanced operations. And generally, I would just want to be really comfortable working with large sets of data and understanding what that actually means. The reason for that is that in machine learning and AI, pretty much everything comes down to the data. Sure, you can use all of these LLMs, you can use these great tools, but if you don't have good data or you don't know how to work with that, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get a good result. So, I'd want to focus on really becoming data literate at this stage getting good at querying data, managing data, visualizing it, etc. So that in the next steps I already had that core skill built. Now moving on to step number three where the next thing that I would do is start working with AI models immediately. Now in the past I would have recommended learn all of this theory, learn all of these machine learning algorithms before you dive into things like LLMs. However, today it's crazy what you can build with even really limited knowledge. So I'd want to dive into this straight away just to see what's possible and to make sure that I stayed motivated. Now, that means I would start working with things like the OpenAI API immediately, things like the Claude API. I would work with things like Olama for running models locally. I'd start dabbling with things like Langchain and Langraphph and building some basic AI agents on my own computer. I'd learn about vector databases retrieval, augmented generation, and start working with some of those tools and building some relatively simple AI apps using Python and using these different libraries. I'd also work with something like Streamlit, for example for building really simple UIs and data dashboards, and that would teach me quite a bit about what it actually means to build an AI application. I'd get a lot of fundamental coding skills kind of reinforced. And then later, I can go on and learn the more advanced AI and ML stuff, which is what I'm going to move into now. Okay, cool. So, now we're moving on to step four, where I would be taking a step back and learning the core machine learning and AI fundamentals. Now, a lot of people today, they dive straight into LLM, which is what we just did, right? We started working with LLMs, building AI agents, and seeing what's possible with Python and some of those amazing tools. However, once you do that, you definitely should still learn these core algorithms because a lot of times it's really overkill to use an LLM for the type of AI task that you need. So, what I mean by this is I would start focusing on things like regression classification clustering. These are machine learning techniques that have been around for 20, 30, 40 years that still work and that you can still use today. I would start looking at libraries in Python like scikitlearn where I could learn how to implement these machine learning algorithms and I can use them to build some basic ML apps. After that, I would start working with things like neural networks. Again a really popular technique that's been around for a while that a lot of people have seemed to forget about. After null networks, I would look at some basic computer vision stuff and I would start looking at libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow to build some more complex machine learning applications that don't involve using something like an LLM. Again, the LLM component is super super cool. You should know how to do that. But a lot of the times you simply don't need it and you can build a better application with a lot of these core fundamentals which really aren't that complicated to understand. Okay, so now moving on to the next step which is step number five. After I got the core machine learning techniques and fundamentals out of the way, I would go allin on LLMs and AI agents. Now, look I know this sounds contradictory to what I just said, but once you build this foundation, you now know what's possible without using an LLM. But this is the new buzz. This is what everyone's using. So, you should be super familiar with this as well. And that's why I would dive straight into LLM and AI agents. Now, the first thing I would want to do is actually understand how an LLM works. understand something like GPT generative pre-trained transformers. What does that actually mean? Understand the architecture at a high level. Get into some of the weeds and see what can LLM do, what can they not do, and what are these magical black boxes that everybody's using on the internet. Now after I understood that, I definitely start looking into some no code tools. As much as we can build everything in Python, it's also really useful to use the tools that already exist. As a developer, you can typically use the noode tools better than people that aren't developers. So, I would start looking at tools like Crew AI, Langflow N8N, things like VPY, LiveKit. There's so many different technologies and tools here for building AI agents and utilizing LLMs. And a lot of times you can build something kind of in their UI platform and then you can hook into it from your Python code and make it really customizable. So, that's personally what I would be doing. And anytime I could use a noode tool, I would if it saved me time and it worked for my particular use case. Again, we're talking about practicality here. How do we practically learn this stuff as quick as possible and get stuff done? Well, sometimes that is using tools that already exist. Now similar to this, I would also be learning about things like MCP servers for example. What are those? How do those work? And then I would start looking into a lot of AI code editors as well. This is kind of more of a sidebar. You may have already done this, but I would definitely want to be familiar with tools like Windsurf, Cursor, uh Lovable, Vzero, Bolt, Replet, all of these AI code editors, how they integrate with things like AI agents and how I could use them to be super productive and build some really cool AI apps. It's kind of like the Matrix here. I'm building AI using an AI code editor that's powered by AI, that's powered by an LLM, that's reviewed by AI. So, AI is really everywhere here, but I just wanted to mention those tools because you definitely should be familiar with them. and personally I would want to be learning them and using them a lot. So this leads me to the final and objectively most important step on my list and that would be to build a ton of AI applications. The only way you get good at anything is by doing a lot of it and doing it in a nonstructured way where you're constantly being challenged and you're trying to build something that you have no idea how to build. That's how I got good at programming. Building literally thousands of small programming projects. That's exactly what I would want to be doing here. just trying to solve real world problems using the AI skills that I built. This is going to teach me more than probably anything else that I had on this list. And I'm going to see how to put these skills actually into practice. So, I'd be building apps to automate business workflows to build maybe internal AI assistants or chat bots. Maybe I'd try to build something like a SAS. I don't know. I would just build a ton of different applications here. Anything that actually was real world and applicable to someone just to really harness these skills. So, there you have it, guys. That is what I would do if I was starting over and I wanted to learn AI and ML. Again, this is not what I would do if I wanted to land a job. I would have some different skills on the list. This is purely if I wanted to be competent in this field and be able to build things as quickly as possible. This is what would work for me. I don't know if it would work for you, but I'm curious to hear what you think. So please leave a comment down below.

                    "transcript": "if you don't have a technical background but you still want to learn the basics of artificial intelligence stick around because we were distilling Google's 4-Hour AI course for beginners into just 10 minutes I was initially very skeptical because I thought the course would be too conceptual we're all about practical tips on this channel and knowing Google the course might just disappear after 1 hour but I found the underlying Concepts actually made me better at using tools like Chachi BT and Google bard and cleared up a bunch of misconceptions I didn't know I had about AI machine learning and large language models so starting with the broadest possible question what is artificial intelligence it turns out and I'm so embarrassed to admit I didn't know this AI is an entire field of study like physics and machine learning is a subfield of AI much like how thermodynamics is a subfield of physics going down another level deep learning is a subset of machine learning and deep learning models can be further broken down into something called discriminative models and generative models large language models llms also fall under deep learning and right at the intersection between generative and llms is the technology that powers the applications we're all familiar with chat gbt and Google bard let me know in the comments if this was news to you as well now that we have an understanding of the overall landscape and you see how the different disciplines sit in relation to each other let's go over the key takeaways you should know for each level in a nutshell machine learning is a program that uses input data to train a model that trained model can then make predictions Based on data it has never seen before for example if you train a model based on Nike sales data you can then use that model to predict how well a new shoe from Adidas would sell based on Adidas sales data two of the most common types of machine learning models are supervised and unsupervised learning models the key difference between the two is supervised models use labeled data and unsupervised models use unlabeled data in this supervised example we have historical data points that plot the total bill amount at a restaurant against the tip amount and here the data is labeled Blue Dot equals the order was picked up and yellow dot equals the order was delivered using a supervised learning model we can now predict how much tip we can expect for the next order given the bill amount and whether it's picked up or delivered for unsupervised learning models we look at the raw data and see if a naturally falls into groups in this example we plotted the employee tenure at a company against their income we see this group of employees have a relatively High income to years work ratio versus this group we can also see all these are unlabeled data if they were labeled we would see male female years worked company function Etc we can now ask this unsupervised learning model to solve a problem like if a new employee joins are they on the FasTrack or not if they appear on on the left then yes if they appear on the right then no Pro tip another big difference between the two models is that after a supervised learning model makes a prediction it will compare that prediction to the training data used to train that model and if there's a difference it tries to close that Gap unsupervised learning models do not do this by the way this video is not sponsored but it is supported by those of you who subscribe to my paid productivity newsletter on Google tips Link in the description if you want to learn more now we have a basic Gra as of machine learning it's a good time to talk about deep learning which is just a type of machine learning that uses something called artificial neural networks don't worry all you have to know for now is that artificial neural networks are inspired by the human brain and looks something like this layers of nodes and neurons and the more layers there are the more powerful the model and because we have these neural networks we can now do something called semisupervised learning whereby a deep learning model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for example a bank might use deep learning models to detect fraud the bank spends a bit of time to tag or label 5% of transactions as either fraudulent or not fraudulent and they leave the remaining 95% of transactions unlabeled because they don't have the time or resources to label every transaction the magic happens when the Deep learning model uses the 5% of label data to learn the basic concepts of the task okay these transactions are good and these are bad okay apply those learnings to the remaining 95% of unlabeled data and using this new aggregate data set the model makes predictions for future transactions that's pretty cool and we're not done because deep learning can be divided into two types discriminative and generative models discriminative models learn from the relationship between labels of data points and only has the ability to classify those data points fraud not fraud for example you have a bunch of pictures or data points you purposefully label some of them as cats and some of them as dogs a discriminative model will learn from the label cat or dog and if you submit a picture of a dog it will predict the label for that new data point a dog we finally get to generative AI unlike discriminative models generative models learn about the patterns in the training data then after they receive some input for example a text prompt from us they generate something new based on the patterns they just learned going back to the animal example the pictures or data points are not labeled as cater doog so a generative model will look for patterns oh these data points all have two ears four legs a tail likes dog food and Barks when as to generate something called a dog the generative model generates a completely new image based on the patterns it just learned there's a super simple way to determine if something is generative AI or not if the output is a number a class ification spam not spam or a probability it is not generative AI it is Gen AI when the output is natural language text or a speech an image or audio basically generative AI generates new samples that are similar to the data it was trained on moving on to different generative AI model types most of us are familiar with textto text models like Chach BT and Google bard other common model types include text to image models like midj Dolly and stable diffusion these can not only generate images but edit images as well text to video models surprise surprise can generate and edit video footage examples include Google's imageen video Cog video and the Very creatively named make a video text to 3D models are used to create game assets and a little known example would be open ai's shape e model and finally text to task models are trained to perform a specific task for example if you type Gmail summarize my unread emails Google bard will look through your inbox and summarize your unread emails moving over to large language models don't forget that llms are also a subset of deep learning and although there is some overlap llms and geni are not the same thing an important distinction is that large language models are generally pre-trained with a very large set of data and then fine-tune for specific purposes what does that mean imagine you have a pet dog it can be pre-trained with basic commands like sit come down and stay it's a good boy and a generalist but if that same good boy goes on to become a police dog a guide dog or hunting dog they need to receive specific training so they're fine tuned for that specialist role a similar idea applies to large language models they're first pre-trained to solve common language problems like text classification question answering document summarization and text generation then using smaller industry specific data sets these llms are fine-tuned to solve specific problems in Retail Finance Healthcare entertainment and other fields in the real world this might mean a hospital uses a pre-trained large language model from one of the big tech companies and fine-tunes that model with its own first-party medical data to improve diagnostic accuracy from X-rays and other medical tests this is a win-win scenario because large companies can spend billions developing general purpose large language models then sell those llms to smaller institutions like retail companies Banks hospitals who don't have the resources to develop their own large language models but they have the domain specific data sets to fine-tune those models Pro tip if you do end up taking the full course I'll link it down below it's completely free when you're taking notes you can right click on the video player and copy video URL at the current time so can quickly navigate back to that specific part of the video there are five modules total and you get a badge after completing each module the content overall is a bit more on the theoretical side so you definitely want to check out this video on how to master prompting next see you on the next video in the meantime have a great one"

                    "transcript": "Wat is wolkrekenaarkunde? So dit is die onderwerp van hierdie video. Nou het jy dalk gehoor van mense wat oor die wolk praat, soos wolkrekenaars of wolkberging, maar jy was waarskynlik nie seker presies wat dit was nie. Wel, die term wolkrekenaarkunde verwys na data en toepassings wat op die wolk gestoor en uitgevoer word eerder as om op jou plaaslike rekenaar of op enige toerusting wat jy besit gestoor en uitgevoer word . Dan word hierdie data en die toepassings wat op die wolk is, deur die internet verkry. So die werklading is nie meer op jou rekenaar of op enige toerusting wat jy besit nie, dit is op die wolk. So wat is die wolk? Nou om dit eenvoudig te stel, die wolk is net 'n groot gebou wat gevul is met rekenaars. Om spesifiek te wees, dit is 'n groot gebou vol bedieners en bedieners is net rekenaars wat dienste namens kliënte lewer. Nou is hierdie geboue baie groot, en dit moet goed wees, want as jy na binne kyk, is dit 'n reuse-datasentrum wat bedieners bevat so ver as wat die oog kan sien. En hierdie bedieners voer talle take uit, soos om toepassings te laat loop, data te stoor, dataverwerking, webhosting, ensovoorts. En hulle is ook almal saam genetwerk en hulle kan op die internet verkry word. So wat is die doel van 'n wolk? Wel, die maatskappye wat hierdie wolke besit, word wolkverskaffers genoem en hul doel is om hul rekenaars as 'n diens te verkoop. Nou is 'n diens net iets wat jy iemand betaal om vir jou te doen eerder as om die werk self te doen. As 'n persoon of 'n maatskappy dus 'n ander maatskappy wil huur om 'n gedeelte van of al hul rekenaarwerklading te doen, sal hulle dit aan 'n derde party uitkontrakteer. Met ander woorde, hulle sou wolkrekenaars gebruik So terug in die ou dae voor wolkrekenaars en as 'n voorbeeld sal ons e-pos gebruik. Dus by jou huis of kantoor as jy e-pos wil gebruik, sal jy jou eie fisiese e-posbediener hê. So jy sal ' n bediener, 'n bedryfstelsel en e-possagteware soos Microsoft Exchange hê. En dan na 'n paar konfigurasie, sal jy e-pos kan gebruik. Maar die probleem is, is dat as enigiets met die bediener verkeerd gaan , soos 'n hardewarefout of 'n sagtewareprobleem, of as die bedryfstelsel ineengestort het, dan sal jy verantwoordelik wees om die probleem reg te stel, om nie eers te praat van enige onderhoud wat nodig is nie. om die bediener aan die gang te hou. U het egter die opsie om al die rompslomp en instandhouding van u eie e-posbediener uit te skakel en 'n ander maatskappy te laat al u e-pos op hul bedieners in die wolk vir u aanbied, soos Gmail Hotmail en 'n klomp ander. Maar e-pos is net een voorbeeld van wolkrekenaars. Daar is ook ander dienste soos produktiwiteitsagteware, webbedieners, databasisse en selfs Youtube. So ja, jy as individu kan Youtube as 'n wolk gebruik. So as jy 'n videoskepper is en in plaas daarvan om jou eie videobediener en sagteware te bou en in stand te hou en die uiters hoë koste van internetbandwydte wat jy nodig het vir mense om jou video's te kyk vanaf jou bediener, kan jy dit omseil en jy kan net jou video's na Youtube oplaai en YouTube alles vir jou laat hanteer. Maar in plaas daarvan om YouTube direk te betaal soos 'n gewone wolkverskaffer, sal Youtube 'n deel kry van die advertensie-inkomste wat deur jou video's gegenereer word. So 'n ander vraag is, hoekom sal 'n individu of 'n maatskappy wolkrekenaars gebruik? Wel, soos ek net genoem het, is 'n groot rede die koste. Met wolkrekenaars elimineer 'n persoon of maatskappy baie van die koste verbonde aan die aankoop van hul eie hardeware en sagteware, tesame met die gebouonderhoud en elektrisiteit wat dit verg om hul eie datasentrum te bestuur. Dit sal dus meer kostedoeltreffend wees om eerder 'n wolk te gebruik. En nog 'n rede is betroubaarheid. Want wanneer jy 'n wolk huur, is die wolkverskaffer verantwoordelik vir al die datarugsteun en rampherstel. En as een van sy datasentrums afgaan, sal hulle ook verskeie oortollige werwe as 'n rugsteun hê wat sal verseker dat daar geen stilstand is nie. En nog 'n rede is skaalbaarheid. Wolkverskaffers sal 'n 'pay as you go'-metode aanbied waar jy net kan betaal vir wat jy nodig het. So of jy 'n paar rekenaars of baie moet huur, dit maak nie saak nie. So as jy net 'n klein hoeveelheid rekenaars wil huur om te begin, kan jy dit doen. Maar soos jou besigheid uitbrei, het jy die opsie om onmiddellik meer rekenaars te huur om by jou behoeftes te pas En as jy nie soveel rekenaars hoef te huur nie, kan jy dadelik terugskaal om net 'n paar te huur. So wie is die wolkverskaffers vandag? Wel, die belangrikste wolkverskaffers vandag is Amazon Web Services of (AWS). Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Alibaba en IBM. Met Amazon Web Services wat die grootste van almal is - wat ongeveer 'n derde van die wolkmarkaandeel neem. Trouens, een van AWS se grootste kliënte is Netflix. Netflix gebruik Amazon Web Services vir byna al sy rekenaar- en bergingsbehoeftes, insluitend databasisse, analise, video-transkodering, ensovoorts. Dus in plaas daarvan om sy eie datasentrum te bou en honderde miljoene dollars te bestee om sy eie data te huisves, het Netflix verkies om dit uit te kontrakteer aan 'n wolkverskaffer wat Amazon is. Dus 'n groot voordeel wat Netflix het om 'n wolk te gebruik, is dat hulle nie hoef te bekommer oor stilstand, sekuriteit, data-rugsteun of die hoë koste om hul eie datasentrum te bou en in stand te hou nie. Hulle kan net Amazon betaal om dit vir hulle te doen. Dit neem dus 'n geweldige las van Netflix af wat hulle in staat stel om te fokus op ander dinge wat met hul besigheid verband hou. Nou is daar drie verskillende tipes wolkrekenaars. Daar is infrastruktuur as 'n diens of (IaaS). Platform as 'n diens of (PaaS) en sagteware as 'n diens of (SaaS). En hierdie drie verskil in beheer en buigsaamheid. Dit is dus aan die gebruiker om te besluit wat by hul behoeftes pas . Die eerste een is dus infrastruktuur as 'n diens. Hierdie tipe is nou basies waar jy die wolkverskaffer 'n gedeelte van jou besigheid gaan laat bestuur wat die hardewaregedeelte gaan wees . Die wolkverskaffer sal die bedieners, berging, virtualisering en die netwerkgedeelte bestuur. Jy aan die ander kant sal steeds beheer oor die sagteware gedeelte hê. Soos die toepassings, data, bedryfstelsel, middelware en looptyd. Enkele voorbeelde van infrastruktuur as 'n diens wat die gewone persoon sal gebruik, is aanlyn datarugsteundienste, soos iDrive en Carbonite wat wolkberging verskaf. En die volgende een word platform as 'n diens genoem. Nou (PaaS) soos (IaaS) laat die wolkverskaffer toe om 'n gedeelte van jou besigheid te bestuur. Maar die wolkverskaffer het meer beheer. In 'n (PaaS) bestuur die wolkverskaffer nie net die hardeware soos bedieners, berging en netwerke nie, maar dit bestuur ook die bedryfstelsel, middelware en looptyd. Jy aan die ander kant is slegs verantwoordelik vir die toepassings en die data. En uiteindelik is daar sagteware as 'n diens of (SaaS) Nou is dit seker verreweg die algemeenste wolkdiens. In hierdie tipe word al die toepassings deur die wolkverskaffer gehuisves. Daar is geen sagteware om op jou rekenaar te installeer nie en geen hardeware om te bestuur nie. Jy kry eenvoudig toegang tot die toepassing en laat dit van jou rekenaar af loop wanneer jy deur die internet aan die wolkdiens koppel. Die wolkverskaffer bestuur dus al die hardeware, sagteware, netwerke, bedryfstelsels en berging. 'n Goeie voorbeeld van (SaaS) is iets wat ek heeltyd gebruik , dit is Google Docs. Google Docs is 'n gratis aanlyn kantoorpakket wat deur 'n webblaaier verkry word. Daar is geen bykomende sagteware wat op jou rekenaar geïnstalleer moet word om Google Docs te gebruik nie. Alles word vanaf jou webblaaier verkry en bestuur. So dit sluit die video oor wolkrekenaars af. Teken asseblief in en dankie dat jy gekyk het."
