                    "transcript": "Hey everyone, Michael Hirs here with Break a Pencil. Hope you're all having a good day so far. Welcome back to our latest in Saturday morning coffee uh about the six personas of product leadership. So today is uh episode five. So, we're going to talk about the innovation architect. And specifically with each of these videos, I've been talking about one of the different six personas of product leadership. And again, these are roles uh that product leaders have to excel at and act as at varying different times throughout their day and week and month as a product leader. And so today is about the innovation architect. And we're going to spend some time talking about how can you use AI to excel in that role. What is the innovation architect? Essentially, you need to create space for innovation whilst consistently being able to ensure your team still delivers. You've got to be able to help your teams experiment, but do so thoughtfully. You want to make sure that you're evaluating new technologies and approaches. And ultimately, you're fostering this culture of innovation and creative problem solving. It's not about just being innovative. It's about creating an environment in which innovation can can thrive. Okay. So, I want to talk a little bit about a maybe it's a cautionary tale. In May of 2010, Microsoft launched this phone. Two phones actually. There's a different model as well. It was called the Microsoft Kin and it was designed specifically for teens who loved social media. Microsoft had done an extensive amount of market research. They had focus groups. They've done all their homework and they had data that showed that teens wanted better social networking on mobile. They launched this phone, an enormous amount of fanfare, a big thing, a big deal. And in 48 days, they shut it down. 48 days from start to failure. What happened? Well, if we look back, and we have the benefit of 2020 hindsight, Microsoft didn't really ever challenge their core assumptions that teens would pay smartphone data plan prices for a phone that couldn't run apps. They assumed social focused that teens were telling them meant social only. They assumed their research methodology was actually capturing real teen priorities. Every failed product I've seen has really one thing in common. Brilliant people who unfortunately never challenged their core assumptions. And frankly, I've been guilty of that as well in my career. So today we're going to dive into how can AI help us with that. So let me paint the scenario first and then we'll jump into the demo. Uh our scenario here is we've got a mobile app and engagement is dropping by about 15% month over month. We've done extensive amounts of user surveys and we know people want more features. They want a dashboard. They want the ability to share socially. They want premium tiers. So our plan is to give customers what they want. We're going to build these three features over the next quarter and we're going to boost engagement. So the first thing we're going to do in the first prompt is we're going to ask AI to extract all the assumptions that are hidden and baked in to this scenario. So I'm going to grab this prompt and today I'm just going to use uh Claude and we'll go ahead and drop that in. And I have to go back and get the scenario because that's being asked for in the prompt as well. Uh, I'm going to describe a product strategy. Your job is to identify every assumption I'm making that could be wrong. Be ruthlessly skeptical and look for hidden beliefs I'm treating as facts. Then I restate the scenario. For each assumption you identify, state the assumption clearly. Explain why it might be wrong. Rate how critical this assumption is to the strategy on a scale of 1 to 10. Focus on assumptions about user behavior, market dynamics, and cause and effect relationships. Okay, let's let it go. So, Claude's going to do a bit of thinking and come back to us. And it identified a number of different assumptions ranked by how potentially damaging they could be. User surveys accurately reflect actual user behavior and needs. Why it might be wrong? Survey responses often reflect what people think they want rather than what drives actual usage. Assumption number two, adding features will increase engagement rather than decrease it. Why it might be wrong? Feature bloat often reduces engagement by making apps more complex and overwhelming. So even though we're giving customers what they're specifically asking for, we might be actually doing more harm than good. Assumption three, the 15% drop is caused by missing features rather than existing product problems. So, engagement drops are more commonly caused by performance issues, confusing UX, broken functionality, or other external factors. You might be solving the wrong problem entirely. Assumption four, these three specific features will meaningfully impact engagement. Assumption five, users know why they're disengaging and can articulate it accurately. and assumption six, a quarter timeline will reverse a negative engagement trend. So just there with that short scenario, AI has helped us identify six assumptions that we're making that could be potentially harmful. So let's go and go to the next step of this process and ask AI to play the devil's advocate. Ask it to argue with us. So we're going to copy this prompt and I'll read it. uh and these prompts uh in this scenario is all available um uh in a link in the description of this video. Now I want you to argue against the top three assumptions you just identified. For each one, what evidence would completely disprove this assumption? What are two to three alternative explanations for the same symptoms? And what questions should we ask to test whether this assumption is true? Be intellectually aggressive. I want the strongest possible case against each assumption. Okay. Assumption one, user surveys accurately accurately reflect actual user behavior and needs. Evidence that would disprove this. Track users who specifically requested these features in surveys and measure their actual usage patterns when the features launch. If less than 30% of requesters become regular users or a featured option is low, the assumption is false. Unfortunately, that does require us to launch the feature. But let's keep reading. uh AB test by removing existing features that users said were essential and see no engagement impact. Other explanations, social desiraability bias, competitor mimicry or post hawk rationalization. And here are some testing questions right that we can ask. Assumption two, look at your own feature launch history. If previous additions correlated with engagement drops or plateau rather than increases, you have your answer. It could be a paradox of choice. It could be core dilution, identity confusion, and some more testing questions. And the same with assumption three that uh technical debt crisis, your existing features are becoming slower potentially. Uh maybe a competitor launched something compelling uh and the external market has shifted now. So, we've got some good devil's advocate to challenge these assumptions that we maybe explicitly or implicitly or intentionally or unintentionally baked into our plan. Let's go to step three, which is let's come up with some other ideas. So, AI, okay, great. Come up with some other hypotheses uh to tell us what might be going on here. Given these symptoms, 15% monthly engagement drop, users requesting more features, generate five completely different root cause theories that would lead to entirely different solutions. For each alternative theory, one, the root cause, why this would create the observed symptoms, what solution would suggest, how would you test if this was correct, think beyond the obvious, users want more features. Explanation, so we'll let this one go. Value perception erosion. Users no longer clearly understand or believe in your app's core value prop. Okay. Competitive displacement. A competitor has captured user attention. Life context shift. Your users's life circumstances have changed in ways that make your app less relevant, but they're not ready to admit the relationship is over. Habit loop degradation. External triggers that used to prompt app usage have been disrupted or eliminated, breaking users behavior patterns. And finally, success paradox. Your app has actually succeeded too well. Users have achieved their goals and no longer need intensive engagement. But you're measuring success by engagement metrics rather than user outcomes. Okay. Okay. So, we've got a lot of different meat to work with here to to really challenge our thinking, to look into this a little bit more clearly and to try to uh get a little bit more creative about how we're looking at it. There's rather really an interesting parallel in this, right? Because the innovation architect, right, is is all about uh being creative and thinking out of the box and and really sort of pushing the limits of thinking. Uh and that's exactly what we just asked AI to do for us about our assumptions, right? um we've asked it to uh come up with this right what's fascinating is that AI is excelling at exactly what great innovators do rapid perspective shifting pattern recognition across domains so before your next product review your strategy through this set of assumption challenges right these set of prompts in five minutes 10 minutes we identified a number of different failure potential points potential failure points that could have taken months or or even longer for Microsoft to discover back when they did the kin and it would have saved them tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars on that product launch. So my challenge to you is in this next week look at your strategy and challenge at least one assumption that's baked into there and see what you discover. You might be surprised and maybe it'll actually cause you to question a little bit of what you're building in as an assumption. Uh, for now that's it. Thanks for listening. I'll see you all next week. And as always, break a pencil."

                    "transcript": "Hi everyone, Michael here from Break a Pencil. How are you all doing? Uh I've got my hot beverage here. Hopefully you have the same. And let's jump into today's uh demo. So uh I've done this in the past in my work with product leaders and aspiring product leaders. I go over this framework called the six personas of product leadership which really highlights different hats that a product leader has to wear. Uh two weeks ago we focused on strategic orchestra conductor. Last week talent gardener moving left to right. Today is all about the vision translator. So the vision translator is all about bridging the gap between inspirational strategy and practical execution. Right? You you you start with these abstract and ambitious and lofty vision statements that companies will put out. Um, and you've got to make them concrete enough that teams can actually use them to make decisions. So, examples, they craft compelling product vision narratives. Vision translators are translating complex technical concepts for business stakeholders. They're ensuring that product vision aligns and makes sense across the organization. And they're helping product managers understand how their work connects to that bigger picture. So they're really that connective tissue, if you will. So the problem is that most product leaders really struggle with this translation. Vision statements sound great in boardrooms, um, but they don't help your teams prioritize features on any given Tuesday afternoon. So let me show you how AI can supercharge your vision translator skills by using actually a real example from my past. So, uh, before I started Break a Pencil, I worked for a company called Here Technologies. Uh, they've been around for over 40 years. They started out as Navtech, then became Nokia Maps. Today, they're Tier Technologies. They're about a billion dollar company. They've got over 6,000 employees. Um, and they shipped 200 million plus vehicles with their maps and data solutions on board. Um, so likely you've interacted with or seen their maps, but very often you don't even know that that's who it is. Uh if you've ever tracked where your package is on Amazon um on the map, it's usually here maps that's providing that. Anyway, uh I don't know if this is current, but when I was there a few years back, the mission statement was creating a digital representation of reality to radically improve the way everyone and everything lives, moves, and interacts. And our vision statement was enabling an autonomous world for everyone. So, these are actually pretty good vision statements and mission statements. It's clear. It's inspirational. It's forward-looking. But the challenge I found when I was a product leader was how do I use these to help me and my team make practical daily decisions? And so if you're a product manager, how do you make the prioritization decision between improving accuracy of a map in rural areas versus building better privacy controls or enhancing our real-time traffic data or developing new APIs for our developers? Uh they don't, right? These don't help with that. So this is where the vision translator persona gets into play. So let's put this into action and see how AI can help us with that. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through two prompts. The first prompt is going to be extracting strategic themes, and the second prompt is going to be giving us some real clear product management guidelines. I'll read these to you as I do them. And more importantly though, uh, as I've typically done uh, with these uh, videos is I'm going to use two different models side by side so you can see both in action. Claude's my go-to for just about everything. So, I always use that. And then Perplexity is going to be the other one I'm going to use today. So I have a company's mission and vision statements. Help me identify the core strategic themes that should guide product decisions. I included the mission and the vision statements as we had. Please extract three to four core strategic themes. For each theme, provide a one-s sentence explanation of what it means in practice and then rank them by strategic importance for product prioritization. Okay. So let's send Claude to work and let's send perplexity to work and what we'll see as we come back. Let's see. Let's start with Claude here on the left. Uh, autonomous systems integration, real world digital mapping, universal accessibility, and interaction layer innovation. So, the vision gets specific about autonomy. This is actually it's asking a kind of a key question for clarification, but let's sort of just keep moving forward and say, look, we've come up with these strategic themes. Now, we're going to try to use these to help product managers make decisions. Uh, what do we have over here from Perplexity? this digital representation of of reality enabling autonomy for all universal accessibility and interactions and mobility looks like similar uh looks like one and two are flipped here. So interesting to see. Okay, so let's go back to our second prompt and copy and paste that in and see how these tools do. Let me paste and then I will read based on here technologies strategic themes create specific product management guidelines that help product managers evaluate and prioritize features. Right? So the strategic themes these were from my practice. So we're going to get rid of those and put these in. Excellent. And same thing here. We're going to put these in place of these. All right. So, we've got both prompts set up and we're asking it to create a decision framework for evaluating new feature requests, three specific prioritization criteria, and questions PMs should ask when reviewing road map items. So, let's let AI go to work on this. And while it's doing that, let me just sort of explain here. As a product leader, one of your jobs is to translate that vision not just for your team, but really for the entire organization. But but when it comes to your team, they need to be able to make decisions, prioritization decisions, uh feature decisions on a regular basis without having to go to you. And you want to make sure that those decisions are being made with the company's strategy in mind. So the ability to give them a a tool that helps them be able to kind of guide those decisions is incredibly valuable. So here what do we have? Tier one strategic alignment check must pass all criteria to proceed. Okay. Does it directly support autonomous decision-making? Does it improve the accuracy completeness of our digital world representation? Uh can this feature reasonably serve multiple customer segments? Impact assessment score one to five. Strategic theme advancement weighted 2x. technical feasibility, market demand, prioritization criteria. Okay. And then here's some review questions, right? So, which autonomous use cases does this directly enable that weren't possible before? Um, how will this scale technically and commercially? Red flags to reject, right? So with some refinement, sure um you can provide your team with uh very clear and this can apply to senior product managers who maybe don't need something like this, but certainly junior new product managers need some guidance. And so you're giving them the ability to make better, more effective, and more informed decisions. Uh similar results here on the right from Perplexity. So uh in about 5 minutes or so we transformed an inspirational but abstract vision and mission statement into practical actionable sorry guidance that product managers can use every day. And this is really ultimately what vision translators are all about doing. So uh I'll put the link uh uh in the uh in the email or in the post um to this document so you can actually run these prompts yourself either against here technologies for m vision and mission or your own companies. Um, so anyway, thank you for watching and uh as always, break a pencil."

                    "transcript": "what does this mean for AI product management simply put solving customer problems using data and enabled by Ai and ml in the past data was mostly used for analytics where once your product is launched you will run some data reports you will do analytics and you'll find some insights based on that you will go back and program something and create products in the world of AI we actually start with data we will try to find out given the data that I have today what sort of problems can it solve or if I have a problem and this is where the product manager's focus should be if if I have a customer problem can AI and ML solve it and then do I have data to solve that problem so that is where this little shift happens but then it comes with its own sets of challenges and this is generally overlooked or we don't um pause to focus on the challenges that Ai and ml is bringing in the product management world and hence many time we are also unable to explain why are these uh challenges becoming a showstopper for getting funding or getting the resources or getting the talent so let's say what is the challenges that this poses like the AI product management one the number one is ambiguity of outcomes and what I mean by that is deterministic versus probabilistic approach if you think about it in the past in the traditional product management world we are very used to selling one or zero computer programs is all about binary uh binary one or zero you will tell your uh let's say a simple website that the submit button has to be blue or when the customer Launches on my e-commerce site and if they are logged in we will say hello Tom so we program the computer we know either this will happen or that will happen we exactly know what our computers are going to be programmed and what the product is going to be doing exactly as we have programmed it to be doing but now with machine learning it is no longer deterministic values it is a probability that you're working on and with that what I mean is now it will be something like the probability that this customer will buy my product is let's say 80% if I show X number of products using a recommendation system the probability of the customer liking the result sets let's say is 90% or let's take even a really significant real world example cancer and Health Care is using Ai and ml a lot  so looking at a x-ray uh x-ray film your ml can make a prediction that with 95% prediction or accuracy the machine learning can predict that this customer may have TB or this patient may have tuberculosis it's only a uh percentage is no longer yes they have it or they don't so that is the kind of variables a product manager has to now play with explainability of outcomes given the data set that we have and the way machine learning algorithms run to create models it many times become a Black Box on how these predictions are given and yet another example of it is you decline a credit card holder of their uh ability to purchase on the the on a e-commerce site you'll say okay as you put your credit card to buy something the backend decisioning engine which is running over a machine learning algorithm will say Okay decline this uh person credit card because you don't know why they said because the front end will just come and decline your credit card on the back end if it is a deep learning algorithm or a machine learning algorithm many times getting to know why exactly the customer was declined becomes a data science issue where you go back and you need to know okay what exactly were the machine learning um uh factors that went in because of which this person was declined so how can you explain your outcomes and then fairness bias and data imbalance the data that you use may not be very balanced it may be skewing towards one segment of people then new infrastructure processes and Tool given the AI uh an ml world that we live in the AI Ops and structure INF infrastructure the processes the tools that we are using is very different than what we are used to and then identifying the right problems to solve that creates the intelligent experience remains still a really big issue for the product managers and hence product managers have become so much more relevant and some of these thoughts I already covered on the previous uh um slides I'll just run through these ones like product managers have become more relevant than ever before to embed intelligence into the product so in the machine learning life cycle the role of product managers have become so important is that going in you should know what sort of machine learning or AI capabilities can be used to solve your problem it cannot be an afterthought and then we will dig into this a little later as well finding that right machine learning problem from the business problem that you have how do you translate it into a machine learning problem so your data scientists exactly know what to model for and then these problems are not easy to go to your stakeholders and Pitch the return of Investments because AI products take a long time to materialize and then finally the very important factor here as a product manager that you need to understand is where is the data within your company who is bringing the data and identifying those right set of stakeholders and groups who have the control of data is very important for a product manager and then the most important thing remains more as a learning THING have a very good operational understanding of the machine learning process who does what and when in the whole machine learning process"

are those differences and deep learning is another one that comes into play I actually did a video on these three artificial intelligence machine learning and deep learning and talked about where they fit and there were a lot of comments on that and I read those comments and I'd like to address some of the most frequently asked questions so that we clear up some of the myths and misconceptions around this in addition something else has happened since that video was recorded and that is this the absolute explosion of this area of generative AI things like large language models and chat Bots have seemed to be taking over the world we see them everywhere really interesting technology uh and then also things like deep fakes these are all within the realm of AI but how do they fit within each other how are they related to each other we're going to take a look at that in this video and try to explain how all these Technologies relate and how we can use them first off a little bit of a disclaimer I'm going to have to simplify some of these Concepts in order to not make this video last for a week so those of you that are really deep experts in the field apologies in advance but we're going to try to make this simple and and that will involve some generalizations first of all let's start with AI artificial intelligence is basically trying to simulate with a computer something that would match or exceed human intelligence what is intelligence well it could be a lot of different things but generally we tend to think of it as the ability to learn to infer and to reason things like that so that's what we're trying to do in the broad field of AI of artificial intelligence and if we look at a timeline of AI it really kind of started back around on this time frame and in those days it was very premature most people had not even heard of it uh and uh it basically was a research project but I can tell you uh as an undergrad which for me was back during these times uh we were doing AI work in fact we would use programming languages like lisp uh or prologue uh and these kinds of things uh were kind of the predecessors to what became later expert systems and this was a technology again some of these things existed previous but that's when it really uh hit kind of a critical mass and became more popularized so expert systems of the 1980s maybe in the 90s and and again we use Technologies like this all of this uh was was something that we did before we ever touched in to the next topic I'm going to talk about and that's the area of machine learning machine learning is as its name implies the machine is learning I don't have to program it I give it lots of information and and it observes things so for instance if I start doing this if I give you this and then ask you to predict what's the next thing that's going to be there well you might get it you might not you have very limited training data to base this on but if I gave you one of those and then ask you what to predict would happen next well you're probably going to say this and then you're going to say it's this and then you think you got it all figured out and then you see one of these and then all of a sudden I give you one of those and throw you a curveball so this in fact and then maybe it it goes on like this so a machine learning algorithm is really good at looking at patterns and discovering patterns within data the more training data you can give it the more confident it can be in predicting so predictions are one of the things that machine learning is is particularly good at another thing is spotting outliers like this and saying oh that doesn't belong in it looks different than all the other stuff because the sequence was broken so that's particularly useful in cyber security the area that I work in because we're looking for outliers we're looking for users who are using the system in ways that they shouldn't be or ways that they don't typically do so this technology machine learning is particularly useful for us and machine learning really came along uh and became more popularized uh in this time frame uh in the the 2010s uh and again uh back when I was an undergrad riding my dinosaur to class we were doing this kind of stuff we never once talked about machine learning it might have existed but it really wasn't hadn't hit the popular uh mindset yet uh but this technology has matured greatly over the last few decades and now it becomes the basis of a lot we do going forward the next layer of our Vin diagram involves deep learning well it's deep learning in the sense that with deep learning we use these things called neural networks neural networks are ways that in a computer we simulate and mimic the way the human brain works at least to the extent that we understand how the brain works and it's called Deep because we have multiple layers of those neural networks and the interesting thing about these is they will simulate the way a brain operates but I don't know if you've noticed but human brains can be a little bit unpredictable you put certain things in you don't always get the very same thing out and deep learning is the same way in some cases we're not actually able to fully understand why we get the results we do uh because there are so many layers to the neural network it's a little bit hard to to decompose and figure out exactly what's in there but this has become a very important part and a very important advancement that also reached some popularity during the 2010s and as something that we use still today as the basis for our next area of AI the most recent advancements in the field of artificial in intelligence all really are in this space the area of generative AI now I'm going to introduce a term that you may not be familiar with it's the idea of foundation models Foundation models is where we get some of these kinds of things for instance an example of a foundation model would be a large language model which is where we take language and we model it and we make predictions in this technology where if I see certain types of of words then I can sort of predict what the next set of words will be I'm going to oversimplify here for the sake of Simplicity but think about this as a little bit like the autoc complete when you start typing something in and then it predicts what your next word will be except in this case with large language models they're not predicting the next word they're predicting the next sentence the next paragraph the next entire document so there's a really an amazing exponential leap in what these things are able to do and we call all of these Technologies generative because they are generating new content um some people have actually made the argument that the generative AI isn't really generative that that these Technologies are really just regurgitating existing information and putting it in different format well let me give you an analogy um if you take music for instance then every note has already been invented so in a sense every song is just a recombination some other permutation of all the notes that already exist already and just putting them in a different order well we don't say new new music doesn't exist people are still composing and creating new songs from the existing information I'm going to say geni is similar it's a it's an analogy so there'll be some imperfections in it but you get the general idea actually new content can be generated out of these and there are a lot of different forms that this can take with other types of models are uh Audio models uh video models and things like that well in fact these we can use to create deep fakes and deep fakes are examples where we're able to take for instance a person's voice and recreate that and then have it seem like the person said things they never said well it's really useful in entertainment situations uh in parities and things like that uh or if someone's losing their voice then you could capture their voice and then they'd be able to type and you'd be able to hear it in their voice but there's also a lot of cases where this stuff could be abused um the chat Bots again come from this space the Deep fakes come from this space but they're all part of generative Ai and all part of these Foundation models and this again is the area that has really caused all of us to really pay attention to AI the possibilities of generating new content or in some cases summarizing existing content and giving us uh something that is bite-size and manageable this is what has gotten all of the attention this is where the chat Bots and all of these things come in in the early days ai's adoption started off pretty slowly most people didn't even know it existed and if they did it was something that always seemed like it was about 5 to 10 years away but then machine learning deep learning and things like that came along and we started seeing some uptake then Foundation models gen Ai and the light came along and this stuff went straight to the Moon these Foundation models are what have changed the adoption curve and now you see AI being adopted everywhere and the thing for us to understand is where this is where it fits in and make sure that we can reap the benefits from all of this technology if you like this video and want to see more like

These are so cute. As I've been taking a break from my job, I've been thinking a lot about like who am I outside of my job. Sometimes I do feel a little bit lost like what am I doing? What do I work on now? But I read this quote, \"You feel lost because you forgot who you are.\" And I think in the past, I've always had a very concrete goal, like working on this presentation, doing this project, and then putting out this video, I also have very specific vision that I built for myself. But the past month, I've been realizing even though I feel lost, but at the same time, I've been telling my therapist, I feel so present in my life. I almost feel like I'm back to this Lillian when she was growing up. She was so curious. She loved learning new things. She's so optimistic. And it makes me realize that when you're goal oriented, you chase. But when you're purpose- driven, you expand. And in that openness is where you find freedom. So my question to you all is who are you outside of your job? So I've been structuring my days into two chunks in this new pace. Today's inspo time is learning about incorporating AI into my job. I don't think AI is about replacing your job. It's about incorporating it into your current workflow and being intentional about it. >> Good morning. >> I also have a script. It's around 10 pages, but I did add some editor notes to it. So, on the topic of AI, there's so much it can unlock these days. If you're designing websites without a coding team, you know how challenging it can be to get started. A framer has just launched some AI tools that have completely changed the game. First up, wireframer. No more staring at a blank canvas. Just type a prompt and framer automatically generates a wireframe tailored to your needs. It's a perfect starting point and from there you can tweak it with simple edits. Next, workshop takes the magic of chatbt to the next level.

These new features give you the creative freedom to focus on design while taking care of the technical staff behind the scenes. You can now try Frameware for free using the link below. [Music] >> When using AI to do data analysis, I think of AI as combining your core business analyst skills like structured problem solving, business sense, analytical thinking, which I covered in my past videos and in my online course to make that process a little bit faster. So, this is my four-step data analysis flow with AI. Let's assume that you're a business analyst at Netflix and your task is to analyze their 2024 revenue performance. I'm using Netflix public financial data from 2024. Step one, building a learning agenda. Think of it like a Google doc with key questions to guide your analysis so you don't get lost in the data. I'm uploading the CSV and using chaptt to help me write faster with this prompt. stating the what the goal task which is to create five to eight questions from the data and please include four things. First, why is it important? This helps you tie each question back to the overall business goal so your analysis is strategic and focused on the business. What business opportunities could it uncover? This helps you think ahead on your business recommendations and not just basic data and insights. Then how will it be measured? This helps you see which field and which data the AI will be referencing from. You can trace the logic back. Lastly, a Google Gemini prompt to visualize it in Google Sheets. I try to avoid being too predictive on exactly what chart type to use so Gemini has room to pick the right chart type. Step two, data wrangling. This is about formatting your messy data so it can be visualized. >> I've already uploaded the data file of Netflix 2024 revenue into Google Sheets. Instead of building pivot tables in Google sheet, I asked ChachiP this prompt to generate a clean summary table for me. Summarize in a table and copy paste a Gemini prompt from the learning agenda. So summarize in a table total revenue by region for each quarter of 2024. Then I paste the clean table into a Google sheet tab. And now we can visualize with Gemini. Step three, visualizing the data in Google Sheets with Gemini. I go into Gemini which is built right into the right side panel and I start copy pasting the prompts from our learning agenda one at a time for example visualize total revenue by region for each quarter of 2024. Gemini then generates a visual and what I like is that Gemini is natively built into Google Sheets so I can see how the logic unfolds and what cells it's exactly referencing from. Sometimes I'll also flatten the table into raw text to make formatting or editing easier. Step four, which I find super important, is applying human judgment. Once I have the visual, I always make sure to refine it to make the storytelling come to life. I always use my 5-second rule when it comes to data visualization, which is can your audience understand this chart within 5 seconds and see its insight. This is the before and this is the after. What I've done is three things. I added bold labels on top to show total quarterly revenue. I also called out Q4 with a dashed outline and a note explaining that Netflix has actually consistently had strong Q4s due to end of year seasonality just to add that extra bit of insight. The third edit I made is to make sure the colors bring focus to the eyes. You can immediately see US and Canada contribute the most revenue out of all the other regions and Netflix. And then using my human judgment, I want to reinforce the point that hey, US Canada is a key revenue driver for Netflix. I then added this chart on the right to show that in fact this market has been contributing 45 of Netflix revenue since 2020. Now this flows really well into my next slide which is seeing the quarterly revenue growth of the region. Then last slide my learning agenda suggests doing arpoo which analyzes how much average revenue does each user bring to Netflix. But using again my human judgment I want to make it more strategic. So I frame the visual as a matrix. So, US Canada leads in ARPO while EMIA leads in subscription scale but lacks in monetization. Lam Apac remain low arpoo growth regions and on the right side you can see kind of the strategic opportunities I've given to each of these regions. As you can see this step is all about judgment, communication, data storytelling and how you bring it to life from the work that AI just did for you. And now a lot of people have been asking me Lilian is AI going to replace business analyst? My take is that just like what you saw in my workflow, human judgment is going to be more important than ever. The types of analysts who I think will really stand out are four things. One is you will have the emotional intelligence. You understand how your stakeholders think, what they care about, how decisions usually get made because at the end of the day you are working with humans in your day-to-day job. So how your work make them feel is super super important. Second is on critical thinking. Those people can break down really complex business problems and know which parts of the workflow meet human judgment and which parts AI can use to speed up. Third one is technical fluency. They can turn structure into prompts. They're able to validate and even push the boundaries of how AI can think. And lastly, number four is human judgment. They know how to tie all the both together in a way that your strategy can speak to people in the room no matter who they are. In the functional business strategy, there's no perfect strategy. There's no right or wrong. There's only a strategy that your team feels the most aligned with. And that's why your voice and your judgment will always matter. >> This is my tennis for today. I love this one collection. [Music] If I were to summarize one word in this last month, it's about learning. Learning new things. Whether it's a hobby, a skill, it all comes from this purpose of being curious. Yeah. >> Oh my gosh, I'm so sweaty. >> My hands are so shaky. Always so hungry after my workout. have been into wearing these type of hats because it covers my forehead perfectly. Looking. And by the way, I've been gaining weight, which I'm so happy about. I'm 44.4. The weather is so nice. [Music] Ex. And a little bit and exhale. [Music] Guess where I am. I booked a photo shoot place. I don't know. I'm in my creative era. I like teaching. I really like sharing my knowledge. But then these days, I' I've been thinking like, what if I blend that educational tips with lots of creativity? And I don't know. Oh, I wonder what that would look like. >> This is why you feel lost on your first day. Welcome to week one of succeed at your internship with AI. You finally made it. But where do you belong? As a past intern turned employee, let's find your seat. Let the earnings report guide you. It's the company's playbook. How it got here and where it's going. [Music]"

                    "transcript": "In 2025, it will take you longer to read something \nand comprehend it than the amount of time it took   to create it. So, if you think finding the signal \namidst all that noise is only going to get worse   with all the AI-generated regurgitation of \nposts on LinkedIn and all the SEO-optimized   blog posts that don't actually contain anything \nvaluable—well, you're right. We have to move   up the knowledge work value chain, and \nluckily, we can do it with AI as well. Let's come back to the fundamentals \nof knowledge work and find where we   can gain leverage. Knowledge work can \nbe broken down into four steps. First,   we have our input—data, knowledge, \nand information that we gather. Then,   we process it to get some sort of output. From the \nfeedback of the output, we then improve our input.   Over time, we're going to spiral upwards and \nimprove the quality of our knowledge work. Now, most people spend the majority of their \ntime thinking about how they can outsource   their thinking process to AI. They are \nusing tools like ChatGPT and saying,   \"Okay, you write this for me; \nyou do that for me.\" However,   we realize the results are not particularly \nfantastic. Why is that? It's because the   input that large language models (LLMs) have \nis pretty average. We're averaging down to   the level of the Internet; there's some gold \nin it, but the majority is pretty mediocre. Instead of focusing on the process, we \nwant to focus on using AI to improve   our inputs. Even if nothing changes \nin the way we process information,   our outputs will be better because we won't \nhave this \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem.   Let's concentrate our efforts on using AI \nto help us improve our inputs. The addition   we are going to make here is to incorporate \nacademic papers and research into our input. Now, you might think, \"First of all, \nthat sounds boring; second of all,   this is practical work.\" This is not some sort \nof academic research that we're conducting;   we need practical outcomes. But think about \nit: Do you read the Harvard Business Review,   McKinsey Quarterly, or the MIT Sloan Review? \nAll of these aim to take boring, hard, complex   academic papers and make them \nrelevant to working professionals,   delivering insights in a way that allows us \nto extract something actionable from them. We need to realize that we don’t want to \nbe readers of HBR. We read so slowly. If   you just feed the entire archive to ChatGPT, \nit will immediately know so much more than   you. We don’t even want to be the writers for HBR \nbecause people spend their entire lives writing a   few insights. Instead, you can leverage those \ninsights. Why spend the time researching? What   you want to be is HBR itself for your team or \norganization. This means going through trusted,   complex, and nuanced resources, translating \nthem into the context you’re in, creating   frameworks that turn theoretical knowledge \nand insights into something actionable,   and delivering it in a way that \nbusy people can understand. We need to move up the value chain and look at \nthings that used to be reserved for academics,   scientists, and authors who had the \nresources, time, and brainpower to   sift through long-winded papers. Now you \ncan too. Let’s take an example and let me   show you the three tools that I use to ensure \nI become the HBR for my team and organization. Let’s use an example of one of the \nbiggest challenges that managers face:   the problem of a team underperforming. There \nare bright people, but they seem like they don’t   want to do anything; they’re always complaining \nabout stuff. How do I improve team performance? Usually, if you get average input, you might go \nto ChatGPT and ask it this question, which will   give you some average results. You might go \nto Google, and it might give you some average   inputs. Let’s give it a try. “How to improve \nteam performance at work?” Common question,   right? Oh gosh, it tells you to focus \non goals and open communication. These   are just such empty, broad recommendations \nthat are not going to lead to great output. What I like to do instead is to use the first \ntool of today: Elicit. This tool helps you find   academic papers related to the question you ask. \nSo let’s copy and paste this and see what kind of   results we get in Elicit. It's free; you just have \nto sign up, and you’ll get something like this:   a summary of the top four papers for free, \nalong with a list of relevant papers. Now, I like to ensure that what I’m \nreading is well-cited and peer-reviewed,   not just some random paper. \nI sort by the most cited.   For example, \"team design features and team \nperformance\" seems to show a relationship.   Let’s take a look at this one. What you \ncan do is click into Semantic Scholar,   which often leads you to the actual paper itself. \nIn this case, it is locked, so if you don’t have   access to a university subscription or something, \nyou might not be able to see it. No problem;   we’ll just copy and paste the paper name and go \ninto Google to see if we can find a PDF version. Here we go: here’s the PDF published by \nSage. Let’s double-check—it seems to be   the right one. Okay, we’ll download this, and \nthen we’ll use the second tool of the day:   Notebook LM by Google. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, \nthis tool isn’t using AI on knowledge from the   internet; it only uses sources that you \nupload. So, you have a lower likelihood   of hallucination. Sign up with your Google \naccount, and you’ll see something like this.   You want to create a notebook, which \nessentially just houses your sources. Since we’ve downloaded a PDF, we’re going \nto upload it here. Now, we haven’t even   read the paper; we don’t really know what’s \nin there. So, what I like to do is use it   as a table of contents first, which is \nautomatically generated by Notebook LM. Now we have a table of contents. \n\"Groups\" is important; there’s   classification theory. It looks like \nwe have to look at characteristics,   some team size, team level, task design, \nand leadership. Okay, interesting. Now,   I don’t want to read this yet; it’s a lot of \ntext and really poorly formatted. But you know,   Notebook LM is still pretty experimental, so \nwe’ll give them some time to figure this out. Now that we have a general idea, let’s \nclick back on the Notebook guide and   look at the suggested questions. Since we \nhaven’t read it, but AI has processed it,   I usually like to use one of the questions \njust to get a basic gist. Here we go:   “How do team design features impact overall \nteam performance?” Let’s see what it says. Looks like there are about three components, and \nwe saw that in the table of contents as well:   team composition, task design, and leadership. \nI love this about Notebook LM. You can click   into this to find the actual place in the \nsource where it discusses this idea. So,   even though this giant paper is probably tens of \nthousands of words, I can identify which parts   are most relevant to me and actually find the \ncitation so I can better understand what they say. Let’s say, for example, that I can’t \nchange the team composition—I’m not   going to fire anyone or hire \nanyone new—but I want to focus   on task design and leadership. I can \nprioritize these cited areas first. That’s the first cool part about the Elicit to \nNotebook LM workflow, but this is only one paper.   What I would do again is go back to \nElicit and now see if there are any   other interesting papers. “Leaders can learn \nabout teamwork by developing high-performance   teams.” That seems interesting. Let’s take \na look and see if we can find the paper. Oh, here’s the PDF—fantastic! Now \nwe don’t have to... oh no, okay,   bad request. That’s all right; it happens. \nLet’s go back and check the publisher. Oh,   it’s a Wiley paper. Let’s \nsee if we can get the PDF. All right, we can’t. If you’re at work, surely \nyour workplace will help subsidize getting this   paper. But even if they don’t, let’s see if we \ncan find it somewhere else. Let’s see if this is   the right one. Fantastic! Here’s the second \nPDF we got. We’ll head back to Notebook LM,   and this time we’re going to press \nthe plus sign and again upload it. Once that’s done processing, you’ll \nsee down here that now you can chat   with both sources. But before we do that, I \nwant to uncheck the previous one because I   just want to understand what this new \npaper is about. So let me generate a   table of contents for this one source, and \nwe’ll see that it’s generating a new note. Let’s wait for that. All right, here \nwe go: there are five essentials to   building high-performance teams: \ncapable and committed members,   norms, a team structure that has clear mission, \nresponsibility, goals, and a framework to get   results. See, this is already so much clearer \nand more specific compared to the Google   search results, which just got diluted \nover time by everyone—maybe one person   starting from the source, but eventually \nsecondary sources dilute the message. Okay, a way to manage team processes, \nand that’s the fifth one. Great! Now   let’s select both sources and ask, “What are \nthe key changes a leader can make in a team   to improve performance?” Now it will look \nthrough both sources and give us an answer. All right, it says: “Focus on member selection.” \nLet’s say that’s not relevant to us. “Promote task   meaningfulness”—this was mentioned in the \nfirst source. Great! “Empower the team with   autonomy.” I don’t know if we’ve seen this. \nOkay, this was in the first document. Great! It gives us the exact things we should be \ndoing: “Cultivate team coordination.” All right,   “Provide effective leadership,” \nwhich means guiding, motivating,   and supporting the team. Let’s see the details. Now, let’s say out of all of this, I think for \nmy team the most sensible action is to promote   task meaningfulness. I want to empower the team \nand facilitate team development, and of course,   provide effective leadership. So, give \nme a detailed plan with three changes   we can implement to improve team performance. Now you have a high-level plan for doing this, \nbut it still feels somewhat vague. Even though   we know the input is good and we’re focusing on \nwhat academics have found out, we want to do the   next part. We’re going to copy this and go into \nClaude and say, “Help me create a detailed plan   to improve team performance using…” and I’m going \nto paste in what Notebook LM has shared with me. In just two seconds, we got a 12-month, \nthree-phase, four-module plan to improve   team performance. Just think about it—if \nyou were in HR or you were a team lead and   you shared this plan with management, they \nwould be blown away. But that’s not all we   need. Let’s say, out of all of this, \nit still sounds somewhat complicated. So let’s ask, “What are the 80/20 changes \nI can make to my team to drive performance   that depend on leaders and not on the team \nmembers to make a change?” I’ll ask it to   refer to these two studies, which are called \na “meta-analytic review” by Greg and by War. Now Claude has a better idea of \nwhere I’m getting these insights   from. Based on the details it knows \nabout these two sources, it gives me   the core leadership action plan. Okay, “Task \ndesign optimization” seems to be one of them,   “Authority distribution” is the second \nhighest impact, and “Contextual support.” So now we’ve gone from a 12-month plan \nto a 3-month plan, and it gives us some   expected results. Whether that’s true or \nnot, we can wait and see. But it helps   us list out things like key success \nfactors and measurement frameworks. Let’s say, “Help me create a matrix to \nbetter design tasks with clear goals   and interdependence structures.” Here we \ngo! Now we’ve got a framework that we can   use to assess goal clarity levels. \nWe can use interdependence levels,   see where they intersect, and even show the \nteam, “Hey, this is what I’m thinking about   for changing how we think about tasks. What \ndo you think?” and get their feedback on it. Now, if we simply ask Claude, “Help me with what \nI need to improve my team’s performance,” let’s   see what we get. All right, it’s asking me a few \nquestions. That’s actually already an improvement   since previous versions of GPT. Let’s say, \n“Work with teams that are underperforming   and unmotivated.” All right, and see the \nplan it gives me is so much more vague. Right? It’s “Communicate and provide feedback.” \nI know this! “Having clear goals.” I know this;   I know all of this. But it doesn’t help. Help me create a framework to set goals. \nYes, SMART is good, and monitoring is good,   but as you can see, because \nthe input quality is not there,   we’re stuck with these buzzwords \nthat we hear all the time. I am excited and optimistic about the changes \ncoming to knowledge work. We can critically   think more; we can actually be more creative \nand associative. Generalists will have a great   time in this era of AI. Let me know how you \nfeel about it. Check out this video on how I   use AI to create McKinsey-style visuals, \nand I’ll see you in the next video. Bye!"

Imagine if you could take those \nlengthy documents and with the help of AI,   turn them into clear, actionable themes, \nepics, and user stories in just minutes.   That's exactly what we're going to cover today. \nUsing AI to lighten your load and streamline   your backlog. Stick around because this could \nchange the way you work forever. Hi, I'm Eric,   an agile coach and Scrum trainer with over 20 \nyears of experience helping product owners and   teams become successful. In today's fast-paced \nworld, time is everything. And as a product owner,   you've got a lot on your plate. Stakeholder \ndemands, prioritizing features, and getting   the most value out of your sprints. Luckily, AI \ntools like ChatGPT can make your life a whole lot   easier, and I'm going to show you exactly how in \nthis video. In this video, we're going to take a   real business requirements document, upload it to \nChatGPT, and let AI do the heavy lift shifting.   We'll generate themes, epics, user \nstories, personas, and an MVP plan,   and prioritize our backlog all within a \nfew minutes. By the end, you'll see how   AI can help you speed up your workflow and \ndeliver more value to your stakeholders. We're going to begin here by going to my computer \nand uploading a business requirements document.   And then I'm going to give ChatGPT a little prompt \nhere. And don't worry, I will put the text to the   prompts in the description of the video. I'm \ngoing to tell it that I'm attaching a business   requirements document. I wanted to read it a \nthousand times. This is a little hack I learned   with ChatGPT just to hammer through the details. \nUse the attach business requirements document to   create themes, epics, and user stories. Make sure \nthe user stories follow the as a, I want so that   format. Create acceptance criteria for each user \nstory. And then I'm going to give ChatGPT a little   reminder here that acceptance criteria are steps \na user would take to verify that the story is done   from their perspective. Let's see what happens. \nSo our business requirements document, by the way,   was for marketing automation software development. \nIt's come up with themes, five different themes   here. It has taken the first theme and broken \nit into epics and user stories. As you can see,   we have the proper text format of a user \nstory here, along with acceptance criteria. It's gotten several user stories for the first \nepic. Now it's moving on to the second epic.   Again, creating more user stories. It's now on \nepic number three out of five. Okay, while it's   chewing on that, the next set of prompts I'm \ngoing to give to ChatGPT for this project, I'm   going to want to say that for an initial version \nof this product, I want to make the most return on   investment with the least amount of effort. What \nshould... I'm sorry, who should I target for my   first launch? That's once it's done generating \nthis content, we'll give it the next prompt   and see what happens. Okay, here comes prompt \nnumber 2, now that I've got my themes, epics,   and user stories. Prompt number 2, for an initial \nversion of this product, I want to make the most   return on investment with the least amount of \neffort. Who should I target with my first launch?   Wants me to go after small, medium-sized \nbusinesses. It's giving me their biggest pain   points, benefits for targeting them first because \nthere's less competition, faster sales cycles,   personalization and simplicity. All great. Okay, \nexcellent. What I want to do now is have it   create personas that represent the audience I'm \ngoing to try to target with my first release. So the prompt I'm going to give it is \nright here. Let's see what it says.   So we've got Megan, the Marketing Manager. \nShe's giving me the goals that Megan has,   the challenges that Megan faces, and the \nneeds and motivation for using my software.   Our second persona is Jake, the startup \nfounder. Getting details about Jake. Okay,   and now persona number three, Lena, the freelance \ndigital marketer. She's a solo entrepreneur,   but she also has a need for our software. That's \ngreat. Awesome. So let's let ChatGPT finish this   work. These are the people we're going to target \nwith our initial release. And now I'm going to   feed it. As soon as this is done, I'm going to \nfeed it a thinking question here based on my   business. So now it's going so far as to tell me \nkey product features for all personas. So these   are the features that ChatGPT says will satisfy \nall three of my personas. My final prompt here   is going to be, based on those personas and \nmy goal of maximum ROI in my first release,   suggest a priority order for all of my \nuser stories. Let's see what happens here.   To maximize ROI, you should prioritize \nuser stories that provide the most   immediate value to the personas and \nalign with the core product features. Great. So it's telling me user story 1.1, 3.1, \n1.3, and giving me rationale as to why each   persona would value that story. So it's giving me \nfour stories to prioritize as highest. These are   my must-have features. It's giving me should-have \nfeatures in a second tier, still generating these   user stories and giving me rationale. So this is \nreally important as a product owner, because as   you know, our decisions are often questioned. This \nis giving us justification for the prioritization.   And then, of course, our bonus or nice to have \nfeatures are lumped into our third category. And   once again, really good on ChatGPT for doing this. \nIt's giving us rationale for all these stories,   and then it's summarizing it all for us. This \nis great. Chatgpt, when you feed it the right   information, can be an incredibly powerful tool. \nAnd as you can see here, has done a lot of the   heavy lifting for us. So to recap quickly, we took \na complex business requirements document and using   ChatGPT turned it into well-organized themes, \nepics, user stories, personas, and an MVP plan,   along with a prioritized product backlog, all in \na fraction of the time it would take manually. This is the future of product ownership, \nand AI is making it easier than ever to   get things done. If your organization is \nfacing challenges with product development,   whether it's backlog management, stakeholder \nalignment, prioritization, I'm offering free   consultations where we can talk through your \nissues and find practical solutions. You can   schedule a time with me through the link in \nthe description below. Let's work together   to overcome these roadblocks and help your teams \ndeliver real value faster.

                    "transcript": "Hey everyone, Michael Hirs here with Break a Pencil. Hope you're all having a good day so far. Welcome back to our latest in Saturday morning coffee uh about the six personas of product leadership. So today is uh episode five. So, we're going to talk about the innovation architect. And specifically with each of these videos, I've been talking about one of the different six personas of product leadership. And again, these are roles uh that product leaders have to excel at and act as at varying different times throughout their day and week and month as a product leader. And so today is about the innovation architect. And we're going to spend some time talking about how can you use AI to excel in that role. What is the innovation architect? Essentially, you need to create space for innovation whilst consistently being able to ensure your team still delivers. You've got to be able to help your teams experiment, but do so thoughtfully. You want to make sure that you're evaluating new technologies and approaches. And ultimately, you're fostering this culture of innovation and creative problem solving. It's not about just being innovative. It's about creating an environment in which innovation can can thrive. Okay. So, I want to talk a little bit about a maybe it's a cautionary tale. In May of 2010, Microsoft launched this phone. Two phones actually. There's a different model as well. It was called the Microsoft Kin and it was designed specifically for teens who loved social media. Microsoft had done an extensive amount of market research. They had focus groups. They've done all their homework and they had data that showed that teens wanted better social networking on mobile. They launched this phone, an enormous amount of fanfare, a big thing, a big deal. And in 48 days, they shut it down. 48 days from start to failure. What happened? Well, if we look back, and we have the benefit of 2020 hindsight, Microsoft didn't really ever challenge their core assumptions that teens would pay smartphone data plan prices for a phone that couldn't run apps. They assumed social focused that teens were telling them meant social only. They assumed their research methodology was actually capturing real teen priorities. Every failed product I've seen has really one thing in common. Brilliant people who unfortunately never challenged their core assumptions. And frankly, I've been guilty of that as well in my career. So today we're going to dive into how can AI help us with that. So let me paint the scenario first and then we'll jump into the demo. Uh our scenario here is we've got a mobile app and engagement is dropping by about 15% month over month. We've done extensive amounts of user surveys and we know people want more features. They want a dashboard. They want the ability to share socially. They want premium tiers. So our plan is to give customers what they want. We're going to build these three features over the next quarter and we're going to boost engagement. So the first thing we're going to do in the first prompt is we're going to ask AI to extract all the assumptions that are hidden and baked in to this scenario. So I'm going to grab this prompt and today I'm just going to use uh Claude and we'll go ahead and drop that in. And I have to go back and get the scenario because that's being asked for in the prompt as well. Uh, I'm going to describe a product strategy. Your job is to identify every assumption I'm making that could be wrong. Be ruthlessly skeptical and look for hidden beliefs I'm treating as facts. Then I restate the scenario. For each assumption you identify, state the assumption clearly. Explain why it might be wrong. Rate how critical this assumption is to the strategy on a scale of 1 to 10. Focus on assumptions about user behavior, market dynamics, and cause and effect relationships. Okay, let's let it go. So, Claude's going to do a bit of thinking and come back to us. And it identified a number of different assumptions ranked by how potentially damaging they could be. User surveys accurately reflect actual user behavior and needs. Why it might be wrong? Survey responses often reflect what people think they want rather than what drives actual usage. Assumption number two, adding features will increase engagement rather than decrease it. Why it might be wrong? Feature bloat often reduces engagement by making apps more complex and overwhelming. So even though we're giving customers what they're specifically asking for, we might be actually doing more harm than good. Assumption three, the 15% drop is caused by missing features rather than existing product problems. So, engagement drops are more commonly caused by performance issues, confusing UX, broken functionality, or other external factors. You might be solving the wrong problem entirely. Assumption four, these three specific features will meaningfully impact engagement. Assumption five, users know why they're disengaging and can articulate it accurately. and assumption six, a quarter timeline will reverse a negative engagement trend. So just there with that short scenario, AI has helped us identify six assumptions that we're making that could be potentially harmful. So let's go and go to the next step of this process and ask AI to play the devil's advocate. Ask it to argue with us. So we're going to copy this prompt and I'll read it. uh and these prompts uh in this scenario is all available um uh in a link in the description of this video. Now I want you to argue against the top three assumptions you just identified. For each one, what evidence would completely disprove this assumption? What are two to three alternative explanations for the same symptoms? And what questions should we ask to test whether this assumption is true? Be intellectually aggressive. I want the strongest possible case against each assumption. Okay. Assumption one, user surveys accurately accurately reflect actual user behavior and needs. Evidence that would disprove this. Track users who specifically requested these features in surveys and measure their actual usage patterns when the features launch. If less than 30% of requesters become regular users or a featured option is low, the assumption is false. Unfortunately, that does require us to launch the feature. But let's keep reading. uh AB test by removing existing features that users said were essential and see no engagement impact. Other explanations, social desiraability bias, competitor mimicry or post hawk rationalization. And here are some testing questions right that we can ask. Assumption two, look at your own feature launch history. If previous additions correlated with engagement drops or plateau rather than increases, you have your answer. It could be a paradox of choice. It could be core dilution, identity confusion, and some more testing questions. And the same with assumption three that uh technical debt crisis, your existing features are becoming slower potentially. Uh maybe a competitor launched something compelling uh and the external market has shifted now. So, we've got some good devil's advocate to challenge these assumptions that we maybe explicitly or implicitly or intentionally or unintentionally baked into our plan. Let's go to step three, which is let's come up with some other ideas. So, AI, okay, great. Come up with some other hypotheses uh to tell us what might be going on here. Given these symptoms, 15% monthly engagement drop, users requesting more features, generate five completely different root cause theories that would lead to entirely different solutions. For each alternative theory, one, the root cause, why this would create the observed symptoms, what solution would suggest, how would you test if this was correct, think beyond the obvious, users want more features. Explanation, so we'll let this one go. Value perception erosion. Users no longer clearly understand or believe in your app's core value prop. Okay. Competitive displacement. A competitor has captured user attention. Life context shift. Your users's life circumstances have changed in ways that make your app less relevant, but they're not ready to admit the relationship is over. Habit loop degradation. External triggers that used to prompt app usage have been disrupted or eliminated, breaking users behavior patterns. And finally, success paradox. Your app has actually succeeded too well. Users have achieved their goals and no longer need intensive engagement. But you're measuring success by engagement metrics rather than user outcomes. Okay. Okay. So, we've got a lot of different meat to work with here to to really challenge our thinking, to look into this a little bit more clearly and to try to uh get a little bit more creative about how we're looking at it. There's rather really an interesting parallel in this, right? Because the innovation architect, right, is is all about uh being creative and thinking out of the box and and really sort of pushing the limits of thinking. Uh and that's exactly what we just asked AI to do for us about our assumptions, right? um we've asked it to uh come up with this right what's fascinating is that AI is excelling at exactly what great innovators do rapid perspective shifting pattern recognition across domains so before your next product review your strategy through this set of assumption challenges right these set of prompts in five minutes 10 minutes we identified a number of different failure potential points potential failure points that could have taken months or or even longer for Microsoft to discover back when they did the kin and it would have saved them tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars on that product launch. So my challenge to you is in this next week look at your strategy and challenge at least one assumption that's baked into there and see what you discover. You might be surprised and maybe it'll actually cause you to question a little bit of what you're building in as an assumption. Uh, for now that's it. Thanks for listening. I'll see you all next week. And as always, break a pencil."
